    <para> The <literal>nltk.probability</literal> module can be used
    to model probablistic phenomena.  Most probablistic phenomena can
    be thought of as experiments.  An
    <glossterm>experiment</glossterm> is any process which leads to a
    well-defined outcome.  For example, rolling a die is an experiment
    whose possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    </para>
    
    <para> A <glossterm>sample</glossterm> is any possible outcome of
    a given experiment.  In <literal>nltk.probability</literal>, any
    immutable Python value or object can be a sample.  Typical samples
    are strings, integers, <literal>Tokens</literal>, and tuples.  We
    can use a simple Python procedure to define the experiment of
    rolling a die; its samples are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: </para>

  <section id="FreqDist"> <title> Frequency Distributions </title>

    <para> A <glossterm>frequency distribution</glossterm> records the
    number of times each outcome of an experiment has occured.  For
    example, a frequency distribution could be used to record the
    frequency of each word type in a document.  Frequency
    distributions are encoded by the <ulink
    url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.FreqDist-class.html"
    ><literal>FreqDist</literal></ulink> class, which is defined by

      <para> Frequency distributions are generally initialized by
      repeatedly running an experiment, and incrementing the count for
      a sample every time it is an outcome of the experiment.  For
      example, the following code will produce a frequency
      distribution that records how often each word type occurs in a
      text: </para>

    <title> Conditional Frequency Distributions </title>
    
    <para> A <glossterm>condition</glossterm> specifies the context in
    which an experiment is performed.  Often, we are interested in the
    effect that conditions have on the outcome for an experiment.  For
    example, we might want to examine how the distribution of a word's
    length (the outcome) is affected by the word's initial letter (the
    condition).  Conditional frequency distributions provide a tool
    for exploring this type of question. </para>

    <para> A <glossterm>conditional frequency distribution</glossterm>
    is a collection of frequency distributions for the same
    experiment, run under different conditions.  The individual
    frequency distributions are indexed by the condition.  Conditional
    frequency distributions are represented using the <ulink
    url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.ConditionalFreqDist-class.html"
    ><literal>ConditionalFreqDist</literal></ulink> class, which is
    defined by the
    <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability-module.html"

    <para> The <ulink

    <para> There is no need to explicitly specify the set of

      <para> In this section, we use a

      initial letter.  To begin, we import the classes we'll be using,

      <para> We then examine each token in the corpus, and determine
      its initial letter (the condition) and its word length (the

    <section id="ConditionalFreqDist.predict"> 
      <title> Prediction </title>

      <para> Conditional frequency distributions are often used for
      prediction.  <glossterm>Prediction</glossterm> is the problem of
      deciding a likely outcome for a given run of an experiment.  The
      decision of which outcome to predict is usually based on the
      context in which the experiment is performed.  For example, we
      might try to predict a word's text (outcome), based on the text
      of the word that it follows (context). </para>

      <para> To predict the outcomes of an experiment, we first
      examine a representative <glossterm>training corpus</glossterm>,
      where the context and outcome for each run of the experiment are
      known.  When presented with a new run of the experiment, we
      simply choose the outcome that occured most frequently for the
      experiment's context. </para>

      <para> We can use a <literal>ConditionalFreqDist</literal> to
      find the most frequent occurance for each context.  First, we
      record each outcome in the training corpus, using the context
      that the experiment was run under as the condition.  Then, we
      can access the frequency distribution for a given context with
      the indexing operator, and use the <literal>max()</literal>
      method to find the most likely outcome. </para>

      <section id="ConditionalFreqDist.predict.example">
        <title> Example: Predicting Words </title>

        <para> In this section, we use a
        <literal>ConditionalFreqDist</literal> to predict a word's
        text, based on the text of the word that it follows.  To
        begin, we load a corpus from a text file, and create an empty
        <literal>ConditionalFreqDist</literal>:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
    >>> from nltk.tokenizer import WSTokenizer 
    >>> from nltk.probability import ConditionalFreqDist 

    >>> corpus = Token(TEXT=open('corpus.txt').read())
    >>> WSTokenizer().tokenize(corpus)

    >>> cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist()
]]></programlisting>

        <para> We then examine each token in the corpus, and increment
        the appropriate sample's count.  We use the variable
        <literal>context</literal> to record the text of the
        preceeding word.  </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
    >>> context = None  # The text of the preceeding word
    >>> for token in corpus['SUBTOKENS']:
    ...     outcome = token['TEXT']
    ...     cfdist[context].inc(outcome)
    ...     context = token['TEXT']
]]></programlisting>

        <note> 
          <para> Sometimes the context for an experiment is
          unavailable, or does not exist.  For example, the first
          token in a text does not follow any word.  In these cases,
          we must decide what context to use.  For this example, we
          use <literal>None</literal> as the context for the first
          token.  Another option would be to simply discard the first
          token. </para>
        </note>

        <para> Once we have constructed a conditional frequency
        distribution for the training corpus, we can use it to find
        the most likely word for any given context: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
    >>> cfdist['prediction'].max() 
    'problems'
    >>> cfdist['problems'].max() 
    'in'
    >>> cfdist['in'].max() 
    'the'
]]></programlisting>

        <para> We can set up a simple loop to generate text, by using
        the most likely token for each word as the context for the
        next word: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
    >>> word = 'prediction' 
    >>> for i in range(15): 
    ...     print word, 
    ...     word = cfdist[word].max()
    prediction problems in the frequency distribution of the 
    frequency distribution of the frequency distribution of
]]></programlisting>

        <note> <para> This simple approach to text generation tends to
        get stuck in loops, as demonstrated by the text generated
        above.  A more advanced approach would be to randomly choose
        each word, with more frequent words chosen more often. </para>
        </note>

        <para> Some of the contexts that we are interested in may not
        be represented in the training corpus.  For example, if the
        training corpus does not contain the word "mango," then the
        conditional frequency distribution cannot predict which words
        are likely to follow it.  If a conditional frequency
        distribution has no information about a context, then the
        <literal>max</literal> method of that context's distribution
        returns <literal>None</literal>. </para>

    look at <literal>roll2</literal>.  Each time
    <literal>roll2</literal> is run, it generates two random numbers,
    and returns their sum.  There are 36 possible combinations of the
    two random numbers, and on average, each of those combinations
    will be chosen one time in 36.  So the probability for each
    outcome is the number of combinations that give that outcome,
    divided by 36.  For example, the outcome 2 can only be generated
    by one combination: 1+1; so its probability is 1/36.  But the
    outcome 11 can be generated by two combinations: 5+6 and 6+5; so
    its probability is 2/36. </para> -->

      <title> Estimating Probabilities for an Experiment</title>

      <para> Probability distributions are often used to estimate the
      likelihood of each sample outcome for an experiment.  Typically,
      we create a frequency distribution by running the experiment on
      training data; and then use the frequency distribution to
      estimate the experiment's probability distribution. </para>

      <para> The simplest estimate for
      an experiment's probability distribution is the
      <glossterm>Maximum Likelihood Estimate</glossterm> (MLE), which
      approximates the probability for each sample as the frequency
      with which it occured in the training data: </para>

    <para> These estimation errors become especially pronounced when
    some samples occur much less frequently than others.  For example,
    if we were to estimate the probabilities of word types in a text,
    then our frequency distribution would likely contain many samples
    that only occur once; and MLE would provide poor estimates for
    these samples' probabilities. </para>
