<section id="intro"><title>Introduction</title>

<para> This chapter addresses the following question: How do we know
that piece of text is a <glossterm>word</glossterm>?
</para>

<!--
<para> This chapter and the following one address the following questions: How do we know
that piece of text is a <glossterm>word</glossterm>? And once we know
that something is a word, what linguistic
<glossterm>category</glossterm> should it be assigned to?
In this chapter, we will also look at a powerful technique for
describing textual patterns called <glossterm>regular expressions</glossterm>.
</para>
-->

<para> It might seem needlessly picky to ask what a word is. Can't we
just say the following?
<orderedlist>
<listitem id="word_def">
<para>A word is a string of characters which has white space
before and after it</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

However, it turns out that things are quite a bit
more complex. To get a flavour of the problems, consider the following text.
<example id="wsj_0034">
<title>Paragraph 12 from <filename>wsj_0034</filename></title>
<literallayout>
It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets
that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea,
some specialists say.  But some European funds recently have
skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.  It has
been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to
1992's European economic integration.  And several new funds that aren't
even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums.

"I'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations," says Smith Barney's
Mr. Porter.
</literallayout>
</example>
</para>

<para>
Let's start with the string <literal>aren't</literal>. According to
<xref linkend="word_def"/>, it counts as only one word. But consider a
situation where we wanted to check whether all the words in our text
occurred in a dictionary, and our dictionary had entries for <literal
lang="en">are</literal> and <literal lang="en">not</literal>, but not
for <literal lang="en">aren't</literal>.  In this case, we would
probably be happy to say that <literal>aren't</literal> is a contraction
of two distinct words. <!--We can make a similar point about
<literal>1992's</literal>. We might want to run a small program over our
text to extract all words which express dates. In this case, we would
get achieve more generality by first stripping oexcept in this case, we
would not expect to find <literal>1992</literal> in a dictionary.--> 

If we take <xref linkend="word_def"/> literally (as we should, if we are
thinking of implementing it in code), then there are some other minor
but real problems. For example, assuming our file consists of a number
of separate lines, as indicated in <xref linkend="wsj_0034"/>, then all
the words which come at the beginning of a line will fail to be preceded
by whitespace (unless we treat the newline character as a
whitespace). Second, according to our criterion, punctuation symbols
will form part of words; that is, a string like
<literal>investors,</literal> will also count as a word, since there is
no whitespace between <literal>investors</literal> and the following
comma.

<!--
Conversely, we might want to look up names of places in a gazeteer (a
list of places together with their associated geographic location), and
in this case, we would probably want to treat <literal lang="en">South
Korea</literal> as a single <quote>word</quote>.
-->
</para>

<para>
A slightly different challenge is raised by examples such as the
following (drawn from the MedLine [ref] corpus):
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>This is a alpha-galactosyl-1,4-beta-galactosyl-specific adhesin.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these sera were 4.53
+/- 0.15% and 8.16 +/- 0.23%, respectively.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

In these cases, we encounter terms which are unlikely to be found in any
general purpose English lexicon. Moreover, we will have no success in
trying to syntactically analyse these strings using a standard grammar
of English. Now for some applications, we would like to <quote>bundle
up</quote> expressions such as
<literal>alpha-galactosyl-1,4-beta-galactosyl-specific adhesin</literal>
and <literal>4.53 +/- 0.15%</literal> so that they are presented as
unanalysable atoms to the parser. That is, we want to treat them as
single <quote>words</quote> for the purposes of subsequent processing.
</para>

<para>The upshot is that, even if we confine our attention to English
text, the question of what we treat as word may depend a great deal on
what our purposes are. If we turn to languages other than English,
segmenting words can be even more of a challenge. For example, in
Chinese orthography, characters correspond to monosyllabic
morphemes. Many morphemes are words in their own right, but many words
contain more than one morpheme; most of them consist of two
morphemes. However, there is no visual representation of word boundaries
in Chinese text.

<note><para>give example
</para>
</note>

</para>

<para>
Let's look in more detail at the words in the text <xref linkend="wsj_0034"/>.
Suppose we use white space as the delimiter for words, and then list all
the words; we would expect to get something like the following:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
120
1992
And
Barney
But
European
European
Fund
I
It
It
Japanese
Korea
Mr
Porter
Smith
South
Spain
a
a
...
</programlisting>
</informalexample>

<!--
We could also be slightly more clever, and produce a listing which 
<programlisting>
% tr -sc 'A-Za-z0-9' '\012' &lt; wsj_0034 | sort | uniq -c
1 120
1 1992
1 And
1 Barney
1 But
2 European
1 Fund
1 I
2 It
1 Japanese
1 Korea
1 Mr
1 Porter
1 Smith
1 South
1 Spain
3 a
1 alarmed
1 are
1 aren
...
</programlisting>

Words according to the Unix <command>wc</command>:
<programlisting>
wc -w wsj_0034_pars12-13
    90 wsj_0034_pars12-13
</programlisting>
-->
Now, if we ask a program utility to tell us how many words there in the
text, it will probably come back with something like the following:
Now, it seems that we can make two different sorts of observations about
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>There are 90 words in <xref linkend="wsj_0034"/>.</para>
</listitem>	

<!--	  <listitem>
<para>the word `European' occurs twice in <xref
linkend="wsj_0034"/> </para></listitem>  
-->
</itemizedlist>
<indexterm><primary>word token</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>word type</primary></indexterm>
This calculation depends on treating each of the three occurrences of
<literal>a</literal> as a separate word. Yet what do we mean by saying
that is some object <literal>a</literal> which occurs three times? Are
there three words <literal>a</literal> or just one? We can in fact
answer "Both" if we draw a distinction between a word
<emphasis>token</emphasis> versus a word <emphasis>type</emphasis>.
A word type is
somewhat abstract; it's what we're talking about when we say that we
know the meaning of the word <literal>deprecate</literal>, or when we
say that the words <literal>barf</literal> and <literal>vomit</literal>
are synonyms. On the other hand, a word token is something which exists in
time and space. For example, we could talk about my uttering a token of
the word <literal>grunge</literal> in Edinburgh on July 14 2003;
equally, we can say that the second word token in <xref
linkend="wsj_0034"/> is a token of the word type
<literal>probably</literal>, or that there are two tokens of the type
<literal>European</literal> in the text.
 
<!--
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Word token</term>
  <listitem><para>an occurrence of a word at a particular
  spatio-temporal location (e.g. a sequential position in a text</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Word type</term> <listitem><para>a more abstract
notion, also termed <glossterm>lexeme</glossterm>&mdash;we speak of two
tokens belonging to the same type.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>-->
More generally, we want to say that there are 90 word tokens in <xref
linkend="wsj_0034"/>, but only 76 word types. 
<!--For example, there are
   five tokens of the type <literal>to</literal>. This distinction
between types and tokens is fundamental, and we will see it being used
many times again.
-->
</para>

<!-- <para> The term "word" can actually be used in two different ways: to refer
to an individual occurrence of a word; or to refer to an abstract
vocabulary item.  For example, the phrase "my dog likes his dog"
contains five occurrences of words, but only four vocabulary items
(since the vocabulary item "dog" appears twice).  In order to make this
distinction clear, we will use the term <glossterm>word
token</glossterm> to refer to occurrences of words, and the term
<glossterm>word type</glossterm> to refer to vocabulary
items. </para> -->

<para> The terms <glossterm>token</glossterm> and
<glossterm>type</glossterm> can also be applied to other linguistic
entities.  For example, a <glossterm>sentence token</glossterm> is an
individual occurrence of a sentence; but a <glossterm>sentence
type</glossterm> is an abstract sentence, without context.  If someone
repeats a sentence twice, they have uttered two sentence tokens, but
only one sentence type.  When the kind of token or type is obvious from
context, we will simply use the terms <glossterm>token</glossterm> and
<glossterm>type</glossterm>.

<title>Strings and Tokens</title>

<para> When written language is stored in a machine it is normally
represented as a sequence (or <glossterm>string</glossterm>) of
characters.  Individual words are strings.  A list of words is a string.
Entire texts are also strings. Strings can include special characters
which represent space, tab and newline.</para>

<para> Most computational processing is performed above the level of
characters.  In compiling a programming language, for example, the
compiler expects its input to be a sequence of
<glossterm>tokens</glossterm> that it knows how to deal with; for
example, the classes of identifiers, string constants and numerals.
Analogously, a parser will expect its input to be a sequence of word
tokens rather than a sequence of individual characters.  At its
simplest, then, <glossterm>tokenization</glossterm> of a text involves
searching for locations in the string of characters containing
whitespace (space, tab, or newline) or certain punctuation symbols, and
breaking the string into word tokens at these points.

<para> There are a number of reasonable ways to represent words in
Python.  Perhaps the simplest is as string values, such as
<literal>'dog'</literal>; this is how words (or more correctly, word
types) are typically represented when using NLTK. </para>

    &prompt;<command> words = ['the', 'cat', 'climbed', 'the', 'tree']</command>
    ['the', 'cat', 'climbed', 'the', 'tree']

example, you could store words as integers, with some mapping between
integers and words. </para>

<section> <title> Text Locations </title>

<para> <glossterm>Text locations</glossterm> specify regions of
      texts, using a <glossterm>start index</glossterm> and an
      <glossterm>end index</glossterm>.  A location with start index
      <replaceable>s</replaceable> and end index
      <replaceable>e</replaceable> is written
      <literal>@[</literal><replaceable>s</replaceable><literal>:</literal><replaceable>e</replaceable><literal>]</literal>,
      and specifies the region of the text beginning at
      <replaceable>s</replaceable>, and including everything up to
      (but not including) the text at <replaceable>e</replaceable>.
      <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.token.Location-class.html"
      ><literal>Locations</literal></ulink> are created using the
      <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.token.Location-class.html#__init__"
      ><literal>Location</literal> constructor</ulink>, which is
      defined in the <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.token-module.html"
      ><literal>nltk.token</literal></ulink> module:</para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> from nltk.token import * </command>
    &prompt;<command> my_loc = Location(1, 5) </command>
    @[1:5]
    &prompt;<command> another_loc = Location(0, 2) </command>
    @[0:2]
    &prompt;<command> yet_another_loc = Location(22, 22) </command>
    @[22:22]
</programlisting>

<para> Note that a text location does <emphasis>not</emphasis> include
the text at its end location.  This convention may seem unintuitive at
first, but it has a number of advantages.  It is consistent with
Python's slice notation (e.g., <literal>x[1:3]</literal> specifies
elements 1 and 2 of <literal>x</literal>).

<footnote><para>But unlike Python slices, text locations do
<emphasis>not</emphasis> support negative indexes.</para></footnote> 

It allows text locations to specify points between tokens, instead of
just ranges; for example, <literal>Location(3,3)</literal> specifies the
point just before the text at index 3.  And it simplifies arithmetic on
indices; for example, the length of <literal>Location(5,10)</literal> is
<literal>10-5</literal>, and two locations are contiguous if the start
of one equals the end of the other. </para>

<para> To create a text location specifying the text at a single index,
you can use the <literal>Location</literal> constructor with a single
argument.  For example, the fourth word in a text could be specified
with <literal>loc1</literal>: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> loc1 = Location(4) </command>     <emphasis># location width = 1</emphasis>
    @[4]
</programlisting>

<para> NLTK uses the shorthand notation
      <literal>@[<replaceable>s</replaceable>]</literal> for locations
      whose width is one.  Note that
      <literal>Location(<replaceable>s</replaceable>)</literal> is
      equivalent to <literal>Location(<replaceable>s</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>s+1</replaceable>)</literal>,
      <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      <literal>Location(<replaceable>s</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>s</replaceable>)</literal>:</para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> loc2 = Location(4, 5) </command>  <emphasis># location width = 1</emphasis>
    @[4]
    &prompt;<command> loc3 = Location(4, 4) </command>  <emphasis># location width = 0</emphasis>
    @[4:4]
</programlisting>

<section> <title> Units </title>

<para> The start and end indices can be based on a variety of
        different <glossterm>units</glossterm>, such as character
        number, word number, or sentence number.  By default, the unit
        of a text location is left unspecified, but locations can be
        explicitly tagged with information about what unit their
        indices use: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> my_loc = Location(1, 5, unit='w') </command>
    @[1w:5w]
    &prompt;<command> another_loc = Location(3, 72, unit='c') </command>
    @[3c:72c]
    &prompt;<command> my_loc = Location(6, unit='s') </command>
    @[6s]
    &prompt;<command> my_loc = Location(10, 11, unit='s') </command>
    @[10s]
</programlisting>

<para> Unit labels take the form of case-insensitive
        <literal>string</literal>s.  Typical examples of unit labels
        are <literal>'c'</literal> (for character number),
        <literal>'w'</literal> (for word number), and
        <literal>'s'</literal> (for sentence number). </para>

</section>  <!-- Units -->
<section> <title> Sources </title>

<para> A text location may also be tagged with a
        <glossterm>source</glossterm>, which gives an indication of
        where the text was derived from.  A typical example of a
        source would be a <literal>string</literal> containing the
        name of the file from which the element of text was
        read. </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> my_loc = Location(1, 5, source='foo.txt') </command>
    @[1:5]@'foo.txt'
    &prompt;<command> another_loc = Location(3, 72, unit='c', source='bar.txt') </command>
    @[3c:72c]@'bar.txt'
    &prompt;<command> my_loc = Location(6, unit='s', source='baz.txt') </command>
    @[6s]@'baz.txt'
</programlisting>

<para> By default, a text location's source is
        unspecified. </para>

<para> Sometimes, it is useful to use text locations as the
        sources for other text locations.  For example, we could
        specify the third character of the fourth word of the first
        sentence in the file <literal>foo.txt</literal> with
        <literal>char_loc</literal>: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> sentence_loc = Location(0, unit='s', source='foo.txt') </command>
    @[0s]@'foo.txt'
    &prompt;<command> word_loc = Location(3, unit='w', source=sentence_loc) </command>
    @[3w]@[0s]@'foo.txt'
    &prompt;<command> char_loc = Location(2, unit='c', source=word_loc) </command>
    @[2c]@[3w]@[0s]@'foo.txt'
</programlisting>

<para> Note that the location indexes are zero-based, so the
        first sentence starts at an index of zero, not one.  </para>

</section>  <!-- Sources -->
</section> <!-- Text Locations -->

<section> <title> Tokens and Locations </title>

<para> As discussed above, a text token represents a single
      occurrence of a text type.  In NLTK, a token is defined by a
      type, together with a location at which that type occurs.  A
      token with type <replaceable>t</replaceable> and location
      <literal>@[<replaceable>l</replaceable>]</literal> can be
      written as
      <literal><replaceable>t</replaceable>@[<replaceable>l</replaceable>]</literal>.
      Tokens are constructed with the <ulink
      url="&refdoc;/nltk.token.Token-class.html#__init__"
      ><literal>Token</literal> constructor</ulink>: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> token1 = Token('hello', Location(0, unit='w')) </command>
    'hello'@[0w]
    &prompt;<command> token2 = Token('world', Location(1, unit='w')) </command>
    'world'@[1w]
</programlisting>

<para> Two tokens are only equal if both their type and their
      location are equal:</para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> token1 = Token('hello', Location(0, unit='w')) </command>
    'hello'@[0w]
    &prompt;<command> token2 = Token('hello', Location(1, unit='w')) </command>
    'world'@[1w]
    &prompt;<command> token3 = Token('world', Location(0, unit='w')) </command>
    'world'@[1w]
    &prompt;<command> token4 = Token('hello', Location(0, unit='w')) </command>
    'world'@[1w]
    &prompt;<command> token1 == token2 </command>
    0
    &prompt;<command> token1 == token3 </command>
    0
    &prompt;<command> token1 == token4 </command>
    1
</programlisting>

<para> When a token's location is unknown or unimportant, the
      special location <literal>None</literal> may be used.  A token
      with type <replaceable>t</replaceable> and location
      <literal>None</literal> is written as
      <literal><replaceable>t</replaceable>@[?]</literal>.  If a
      token's location is not specified, it defaults to
      <literal>None</literal>: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> token1 = Token('hello', None) </command>
    'hello'@[?]
    &prompt;<command> token2 = Token('world') </command>
    'world'@[?]
</programlisting>

<para> A Token with a location of <literal>None</literal> is not
      considered to be equal to any other token.  In particular, even
      if two tokens have the same type, and both have a location of
      <literal>None</literal>, they are not equal: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> token1 = Token('hello') </command>
    'hello'@[?]
    &prompt;<command> token2 = Token('hello') </command>
    'hello'@[?]
    &prompt;<command> token1 == token2 </command>
    0
</programlisting>

<para> To access a token's type, use its <ulink
      url="&refdoc;/nltk.token.Token-class.html#type"
      ><literal>type</literal></ulink> member function; and to access a
      token's location, use its <ulink

<section> <title> Texts </title>

<para> Many natural language processing tasks involve analyzing
    texts of varying sizes, ranging from single sentences to very
    large corpora.  There are a number of ways to represent texts
    using NLTK.  The simplest is as a single
    <literal>string</literal>.  These strings are typically loaded
    from files: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> text_str = open('corpus.txt').read() </command>
    'Hello world.  This is a test file.\n'
</programlisting>

<para> It is often more convenient to represent a text as a
    <literal>list</literal> of <literal>Token</literal>s.  These
    <literal>list</literal>s are typically created using a
    <glossterm>tokenizer</glossterm>, such as <ulink
    url="&refdoc;/nltk.tokenizer.WSTokenizer-class.html"
    ><literal>WSTokenizer</literal></ulink> (which splits words apart
    based on whitespace): </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> from nltk.tokenizer import * </command>
    &prompt;<command> text_tok_list = WSTokenizer().tokenize(text_str) </command>
    ['Hello'@[0w], 'world.'@[1w], 'This'@[2w], 'is'@[3w], 
     'a'@[4w], 'test'@[5w], 'file.'@[6w]]
</programlisting>

<para> Texts can also be represented as sets of word tokens or
    sets of word types: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> text_tok_set = Set(*text_tok_list) </command>
    {'This'@[2w], 'a'@[4w], 'Hello'@[0w], 'world.'@[1w], 
     'is'@[3w], 'file.'@[6w], 'test'@[5w]}
</programlisting>

<note> <para> For example, this representation might be convenient for a
search engine which is trying to find all documents containing some
keyword. (For more information on why a "<literal>*</literal>" is used
in the call to the Set constructor, see the Set tutorial.)  <!-- WRITE
THE SET TUTORIAL!! -->
</para> </note>

</section> <!-- Texts -->

<section> <title>NLTK Tokenizers </title>

<!-- As mentioned in the previous section, it is often useful to
represent a text as a list of tokens.  The process of breaking a text up
into its constituent tokens is known as
<glossterm>tokenization</glossterm> -->

<para> As we saw in <xref
	linkend="tokenization"/>, tokenization involves breaking a text
up into its constituent tokens prior to further processing. Tokenization
in NLTK can occur at a number of different levels: a text could be
broken up into paragraphs, sentences, words, syllables, or phonemes. And
for any given level of tokenization, there are many different algorithms
for breaking up the text.  For example, at the word level, it is not
immediately clear how to treat such strings as <literal>can't</literal>
<literal>$22.50</literal> <literal>New York</literal> and
<literal>so-called</literal>.
</para>

<para> NLTK defines a general interface for tokenizing texts, the
    <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.tokenizer.TokenizerI-class.html"
    ><literal>TokenizerI</literal></ulink> class.  This interface is
    used by all tokenizers, regardless of what level they tokenize at
    or what algorithm they use.  It defines a single method, <ulink
    url="&refdoc;/nltk.tokenizer.TokenizerI-class.html#tokenize"
    ><literal>tokenize</literal></ulink>, which takes a
    <literal>string</literal>, and returns a list of
    <literal>Token</literal>s.  </para>

<section> <title> The whitespace tokenizer </title> 

<para> A simple example of a tokenizer is the
      <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.tokenizer.WSTokenizer-class.html"
      ><literal>WSTokenizer</literal></ulink>, which breaks a text into
      words, assuming that words are separated by whitespace (space,
      enter, and tab characters).  We can use the
      <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.tokenizer.WSTokenizer-class.html#__init__"
      ><literal>WSTokenizer</literal> constructor</ulink> to build a
      new whitespace tokenizer: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer = WSTokenizer() </command>
</programlisting>

<para> Once we have built the tokenizer, we can use it to
      process texts: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer.tokenize(text_str) </command>
    ['Hello'@[0w], 'world.'@[1w], 'This'@[2w], 'is'@[3w], 
     'a'@[4w], 'test'@[5w], 'file.'@[6w]]
</programlisting>

<para> However, this tokenizer is not ideal for many tasks.  For
      example, we might want punctuation to be included as separate
      tokens; or we might want names like "New York" to be included as
      single tokens. </para>

</section> <!-- Whitespace tokenizer -->
<section> <title> The regular expression tokenizer </title>

<para> The <literal>RETokenizer</literal> is a more powerful
      tokenizer, which uses a regular expression to determine how text
      should be split up.  This regular expression specifies the
      format of a valid word.  For example, if we wanted to mimic the
      behavior or <literal>WSTokenizer</literal>, we could define the
      following <literal>RETokenizer</literal>: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer = RETokenizer(r'[^\s]+') </command>
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer.tokenize(example_text) </command>
    ['Hello.'@[0w], "Isn't"@[1w], 'this'@[2w], 'fun?'@[3w]]
</programlisting>

<para> (The regular expression <literal>\s</literal> matches any
      whitespace character.) </para>

<para> To define a tokenizer that includes punctuation as
      separate tokens, we could use: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> regexp = r'\w+|[^\w\s]+'</command>
    '\w+|[^\w\s]+'
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer = RETokenizer(regexp) </command>
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer.tokenize(example_text) </command>
    ['Hello'@[0w], '.'@[1w], 'Isn'@[2w], "'"@[3w], 't'@[4w], 
     'this'@[5w], 'fun'@[6w], '?'@[7w]]
</programlisting>

<para> The regular expression in this example will match
      <emphasis>either</emphasis> a sequence of alphanumeric
      characters (letters and numbers); <emphasis>or</emphasis> a
      sequence of punctuation characters. </para>

<para> There are a number of ways we might want to improve this
      regular expression.  For example, it currently breaks the string
      "$22.50" into four tokens; but we might want it to include this
      as a single token.  One approach to making this change would be
      to add a new clause to the tokenizer's regular expression, which
      is specialized for handling strings of this form: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> example_text = 'That poster costs $22.40.'</command>
    &prompt;<command> regexp = r'(\w+)|(\$\d+\.\d+)|([^\w\s]+)'</command>
    '(\w+)|(\$\d+\.\d+)|([^\w\s]+)'
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer = RETokenizer(regexp) </command>
    &prompt;<command> tokenizer.tokenize(example_text) </command>
    ['That'@[0w], 'poster'@[1w], 'costs'@[2w], '$22.40'@[3w], '.'@[4w]]
</programlisting>

<para> Of course, more general solutions to this problem are
      also possible, using different regular expressions. </para>

</section> <!-- Tokenization -->

<section> <title> Example: Processing Tokenized Text </title>

<para> In this section, we show how you can use NLTK to
    examine the distribution of word lengths in a document.  This is
    meant to be a simple example of how the tools we have introduced
    can be used to solve a simple NLP problem.  The distribution of
    word lengths in a document can give clues to other properties,
    such as the document's style, or the document's language. </para>

<para> We present three different approaches to solving this
    problem; each one illustrates different techniques, which might be
    useful for other problems. </para>

<section> <title> Word Length Distributions 1: Using a List </title>

<para> To begin with, we'll need to extract the words from a
      corpus that we wish to test.  We'll use the
      <literal>WSTokenizer</literal> to tokenize the corpus: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> corpus = open('corpus.txt').read() </command>
    &prompt;<command> tokens = WSTokenizer().tokenize(corpus) </command>
</programlisting>

<para> Now, we will construct a list
      <literal>wordlen_count_list</literal>, which gives the number of
      words that have a given length.  In particular,
      <literal>wordlen_count_list[<replaceable>i</replaceable>]</literal>
      is the number of words whose length is
      <replaceable>i</replaceable>. </para>

<para> When constructing this list, we must be careful not to
      try to add a value past the end of the list.  Therefore,
      whenever we encounter a word that is longer than any previous
      words, we will add enough zeros to
      <literal>wordlen_count_list</literal> that we can store the
      occurrence of the new word:

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> wordlen_count_list = []</command>
    &prompt;<command> for token in tokens:</command>
    &prompt2;<command>     wordlen = len(token.type())</command>
    &prompt2;     <emphasis># Add zeros until wordlen_count_list is long enough</emphasis>
    &prompt2;<command>     while wordlen >= len(wordlen_count_list):</command>
    &prompt2;<command>         wordlen_count_list.append(0)</command>
    &prompt2;     <emphasis># Increment the count for this word length</emphasis>
    &prompt2;<command>     wordlen_count_list[wordlen] += 1</command>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para> We can plot the results, using the <ulink
      url="&refdoc;/nltk.draw.plot.Plot-class.html"
      ><literal>Plot</literal></ulink> class, defined in the
      <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.draw.plot-module.html"
      ><literal>nltk.draw.plot</literal></ulink> module: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> Plot(wordlen_count_list)</command>
</programlisting>

<note> <para> We are currently using a fairly simple class to
      plot functions.  We will likely replace it with a more advanced
      plotting system in the future. </para> </note>

<para> The complete code for this example, including necessary
      <literal>import</literal> statements, is: </para>

<programlisting>
from nltk.tokenizer import WSTokenizer
from nltk.draw.plot import Plot

<emphasis># Extract a list of words from the corpus</emphasis>
corpus = open('corpus.txt').read() 
tokens = WSTokenizer().tokenize(corpus) 

<emphasis># Count up how many times each word length occurs</emphasis>
wordlen_count_list = []
for token in tokens:
     wordlen = len(token.type())
     <emphasis># Add zeros until wordlen_count_list is long enough</emphasis>
     while wordlen >= len(wordlen_count_list):
         wordlen_count_list.append(0)
     <emphasis># Increment the count for this word length</emphasis>
     wordlen_count_list[wordlen] += 1

Plot(wordlen_count_list)

<section> <title> Word Length Distributions 2: Using a Dictionary </title>

<para> We have been examining the function from word lengths to
      token counts.  In this example, the range of the function (i.e.,
      the set of word lengths) is ordered and relatively small.
      However, we often wish to examine functions whose ranges are not
      so well behaved.  In such cases, dictionaries can be a powerful
      tool.  The following code uses a dictionary to count up the
      number of times each word length occurs: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> wordlen_count_dict = {}</command>
    &prompt;<command> for token in tokens:</command>
    &prompt2;<command>     word_length = len(token.type())</command>
    &prompt2;<command>     if wordlen_count_dict.has_key(word_length):</command>
    &prompt2;<command>         wordlen_count_dict[word_length] += 1</command>
    &prompt2;<command>     else:</command>
    &prompt2;<command>         wordlen_count_dict[word_length] = 1</command>
</programlisting>

<para> To plot the results, we can use a list of (wordlen,
      count) pairs.  This is simply the <literal>items</literal> of
      the dictionary: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> points = wordlen_count_dict.items() </command>
    &prompt;<command> Plot(points)</command>
</programlisting>

<para> The complete code for this example, including necessary
      <literal>import</literal> statements, is: </para>

<programlisting>
from nltk.tokenizer import WSTokenizer
from nltk.draw.plot import Plot

<emphasis># Extract a list of words from the corpus</emphasis>
corpus = open('corpus.txt').read() 
tokens = WSTokenizer().tokenize(corpus) 

<emphasis># Construct a dictionary mapping word lengths to token counts</emphasis>
wordlen_count_dict = {}
for token in tokens:
    word_length = len(token.type())
    if wordlen_count_dict.has_key(word_length):
        wordlen_count_dict[word_length] += 1
    else:
        wordlen_count_dict[word_length] = 1

<emphasis># Construct a list of (wordlen, count) and plot the results.</emphasis>

<section> <title> Word Length Distributions 3: Using a Frequency Distribution </title>

<para> The <ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability-module.html"
      ><literal>nltk.probability</literal></ulink> module defines two
      interfaces, <ulink
      url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.FreqDistI-class.html"
      ><literal>FreqDistI</literal></ulink> and <ulink
      url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.ProbDistI-class.html"
      ><literal>ProbDistI</literal></ulink>, for modeling frequency
      distributions and probability distributions, respectively.  In
      this example, we use a frequency distribution to find the
      relationship between word lengths and token counts. </para>

<para> We will use a <ulink
      url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.SimpleFreqDist-class.html"
      ><literal>SimpleFreqDist</literal></ulink>, which is a simple
      (but sometimes inefficient) implementation of the
      <literal>FreqDistI</literal> interface.  For this example, three
      methods of <literal>SimpleFreqDist</literal> are
      relevant:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.SimpleFreqDist-class.html#inc"><literal>inc(<replaceable>sample</replaceable>)</literal></ulink>
          increments the frequency of a given sample.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para><ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.SimpleFreqDist-class.html#samples"><literal>samples()</literal></ulink> returns a list of
          the samples covered by a frequency distribution.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para><ulink url="&refdoc;/nltk.probability.SimpleFreqDist-class.html#count"><literal>count(<replaceable>sample</replaceable>)</literal></ulink>
          returns the number of times a given sample occurred.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para> First, we construct the frequency distribution for the
      word lengths: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> wordlen_freqs = SimpleFreqDist()</command>
    &prompt;<command> for token in tokens:</command>
    &prompt2;<command>     wordlen_freqs.inc(len(token.type()))</command>
</programlisting>

<para> Next, we extract the set of word lengths that were found
      in the corpus: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> wordlens = wordlen_freqs.samples()</command>
</programlisting>

<para> Finally, we construct a list of (wordlen, count) pairs,
      and plot it: </para>

<programlisting>
    &prompt;<command> points = [(wordlen, wordlen_freqs.count(wordlen))</command>
    &prompt2;<command>           for wordlen in wordlens]</command>
    &prompt;<command> Plot(points)</command>
</programlisting>

<note> <para> The expression
      <literal>[...&nbsp;for&nbsp;...&nbsp;in&nbsp;...]</literal> is
      called a "list comprehension."  For more information on list
      comprehensions, see the <ulink
