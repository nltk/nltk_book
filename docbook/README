This directory contains all of the files that should be needed by
Jade/OpenJade to produce output from docbook documents.  These are
used primarily by the tutorials (nltk/doc/tutorial), but may also be
used by some other documentation.  We include these files in the CVS
repository, rather than relying on a local distribution, because:
  - local distributions put the files in very different places
  - not all local distributions will have DTD/DSSSL versions that
    match our docbook documents

These files are *not* considered part of the NLTK package; in
particular, they are not covered by its license, and should not be
included with nltk distributions.

Directory contents:
  - collateindex.pl: A perl script for producing Docbook indices
  - catalog: A DTD catalog file, used by (Open)Jade to find entities,
    DTDs, DSSSLs, etc
  - xml.dcl: SGML declaration for XML (defines XML)
  - docbook-utils.dsl: Docbook DSSSL customization file
  - sgml/sgml-iso-entities-8879.1986: ISO character entities
  - sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.2: XML-Docbook DTD
  - sgml/docbook/docbook-dsssl-1.78: XML-Docbook stylesheets
  - sgml/openjade-1.3.2/: stylesheets used by (Open)Jade

The only file that we modify ourselves is "docbook-utils.dsl".  This
is a customization file for the DSSSL stylesheets; it is used to
adjust the output (e.g., how sections are divided into web
pages/chapters, margins for text outputs, fonts, etc.).
