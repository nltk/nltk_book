Object-Oriented Programming in Python
-------------------------------------

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm in which
complex structures and processes are decomposed into modules,
each encapsulating a single data type and the legal operations on
that type.

Data Classes: Trees in NLTK
---------------------------

An important data type in language processing is the syntactic tree.
Here we will review the parts of the NLTK code which defines the ``Tree``
class.  

The first line of a class definition is the ``class`` keyword followed
by the class name, in this case ``Tree``.  This class is derived from
Python's built-in ``list`` class, permitting us to use standard list
operations to access the children of a tree node.

    >>> class Tree(list):

Next we define the initializer, also known as the `constructor`:lx:.
It has a special name, starting and ending with double underscores;
Python knows to call this function when you asks for a new tree object
by writing ``t = Tree(node, children)``.  The constructor's first argument
is special, and is standardly called ``self``, giving us a way to
refer to the current object from inside the definition.  This
constructor calls the list initializer (similar to calling ``self =
list(children)``), then defines the ``node`` property of a tree.

    ...     def __init__(self, node, children):
    ...         list.__init__(self, children)
    ...         self.node = node

Next we define another special function that Python knows to call when
we index a Tree.  The first case is the simplest, when the index is an
integer, e.g. ``t[2]``, we just ask for the list item in the obvious
way.  The other cases are for handling slices, like ``t[1:2]``, or ``t[:]``.

    ...     def __getitem__(self, index):
    ...         if isinstance(index, int):
    ...             return list.__getitem__(self, index)
    ...         else:
    ...             if len(index) == 0:
    ...                 return self
    ...             elif len(index) == 1:
    ...                 return self[int(index[0])]
    ...             else:
    ...                 return self[int(index[0])][index[1:]]
    ...     

.. SB: what is the len(index) == 0 case for???

This method was for accessing a child node.  Similar methods are
provided for setting and deleting a child (using ``__setitem__``)
and ``__delitem__``).

Two other special member functions are ``__repr__()`` and ``__str__()``.
The ``__repr__()`` function produces a string representation of the
object, one which can be executed to re-create the object, and is
accessed from the interpreter simply by typing the name of the object
and pressing 'enter'.  The ``__str__()`` function produces a human-readable
version of the object; here we call a pretty-printing function we have
defined called ``pp()``.

    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         childstr = ' '.join([repr(c) for c in self])
    ...         return '(%s: %s)' % (self.node, childstr)
    ...     def __str__(self):
    ...         return self.pp()


Next we define some member functions that do other standard operations
on trees.  First, for accessing the leaves:

    ...     def leaves(self):
    ...         leaves = []
    ...         for child in self:
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 leaves.extend(child.leaves())
    ...             else:
    ...                 leaves.append(child)
    ...         return leaves


Next, for computing the height:

    ...     def height(self):
    ...         max_child_height = 0
    ...         for child in self:
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 max_child_height = max(max_child_height, child.height())
    ...             else:
    ...                 max_child_height = max(max_child_height, 1)
    ...         return 1 + max_child_height

And finally, for enumerating all the subtrees (optionally filtered):

    ...     def subtrees(self, filter=None):
    ...         if not filter or filter(self):
    ...             yield self
    ...         for child in self:
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 for subtree in child.subtrees(filter):
    ...                     yield subtree


Processing Classes: N-gram Taggers in NLTK
------------------------------------------

This section will discuss the ``tag.ngram`` module.

Algorithm Design
----------------

An *algorithm* is a "recipe" for solving a problem.  For example,
to multiply 16 by 12 we might use any of the following methods:

1. Add 16 to itself 12 times over
#. Perform "long multiplication", starting with the least-significant
   digits of both numbers
#. Look up a multiplication table
#. Repeatedly halve the first number and double the second,
   16*12 = 8*24 = 4*48 = 2*96 = 192
#. Do 10*12 to get 120, then add 6*12

Each of these methods is a different algorithm, and requires different
amounts of computation time and different amounts of intermediate
information to store.  A similar situation holds for many other
superficially simple tasks, such as sorting a list of words.  Now, as
we saw above, Python provides a built-in function ``sort()`` that
performs this task efficiently.  However, NLTK-Lite also provides
several algorithms for sorting lists, to illustrate the variety of
possible methods.  To illustrate the difference in efficiency, we
will create a list of 1000 numbers, randomize the list, then sort it,
counting the number of list manipulations required.

  >>> from random import shuffle
  >>> a = range(1000)                     # [0,1,2,...999]
  >>> shuffle(a)                          # randomize

Now we can try a simple sort method called *bubble sort*, which
scans through the list many times, exchanging adjacent items if
they are out of order.  It sorts the list ``a`` in-place, and returns
the number of times it modified the list:

  >>> from nltk_lite.misc import sort
  >>> sort.bubble(a)
  250918

We can try the same task using various sorting algorithms.  Evidently
*merge sort* is much better than bubble sort, and *quicksort* is better still.

  >>> shuffle(a); sort.merge(a)
  6175
  >>> shuffle(a); sort.quick(a)
  2378

Readers are encouraged to look at ``nltk_lite.misc.sort`` to see how
these different methods work.  The collection of NLTK-Lite modules
exemplify a variety of algorithm design techniques, including
brute-force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy search.
Readers who would like a systematic introduction to algorithm design
should consult the resources mentioned at the end of this tutorial.

Exercises
---------

1. Consider again the problem of hyphenation across linebreaks.
   Suppose that you have successfully written a tokenizer that
   returns a list of strings, where some strings may contain
   a hyphen followed by a newline character, e.g. ``long-\nterm``.
   Write a function which iterates over the tokens in a list,
   removing the newline character from each, in each of the following
   ways:

   a) Use doubly-nested for loops.  The outer loop will iterate over
      each token in the list, while the inner loop will iterate over
      each character of a string.

   b) Replace the inner loop with a call to ``re.sub()``

   c) Finally, replace the outer loop with call to the ``map()``
      function, to apply this substitution to each token.

   d) Discuss the clarity (or otherwise) of each of these approaches.

2. Develop a simple extractive summarization tool, which prints the
   sentences of a document which contain the highest total word
   frequency.  Use ``FreqDist`` to count word frequencies, and use
   ``sum`` to sum the frequencies of the words in each sentence.
   Rank the sentences according to their score.  Finally, print the *n*
   highest-scoring sentences in document order.  Carefully review the
   design of your program, especially your approach to this double
   sorting.  Make sure the program is written as clearly as possible.
