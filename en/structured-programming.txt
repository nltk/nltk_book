Introduction
------------

In Part I you had an intensive introduction to Python (Chapter chap-programming_)
followed by chapters on words, tags, and chunks (Chapters chap-words_\ -\ chap-chunk_).
These chapters contain many examples and exercises
that should have helped you consolidate your Python skills
and apply them to simple NLP tasks.  So far our programs |mdash| and the data we have 
been processing |mdash| have been relatively unstructured.
In Part II we will focus on `structure`:em:\ : i.e. structured programming
with structured data.

In this chapter we will review key programming concepts and explain
many of the minor points that could easily trip you up.  More fundamentally,
we will introduce important concepts in structured programming that
help you write readable, well-organized programs that you and others will
be able to re-use.  Each section is independent, so you can easily select
what you most need to learn and concentrate on that.
As before, this chapter contains many examples and
exercises (and as before, some exercises introduce new material).
Readers new to programming should work through them carefully
and consult other introductions to programming if necessary;
experienced programmers can quickly skim this chapter.

.. _sec-back-to-the-basics:

------------------
Back to the Basics
------------------

Let's begin by revisiting some of the fundamental operations and data structures
required for natural language processing in Python.  It is important to appreciate
several finer points in order to write Python programs which are not
only correct but also `idiomatic`:em: |mdash| by this, we mean using the
features of the Python language in a natural and concise way. To
illustrate, here is a technique for iterating over the members
of a list by initializing an index ``i`` and then incrementing the
index each time we pass through the loop:

    >>> sent = ['I', 'am', 'the', 'Walrus']
    >>> i = 0
    >>> while i < len(sent):
    ...     sent[i].lower()
    ...     i += 1
    >>> sent
    ['i', 'am', 'the', 'walrus']

Although this does the job, it is not idiomatic Python. By
contrast, Python's ``for`` statement allows us to achieve the same
effect much more succinctly:

    >>> sent = ['I', 'am', 'the', 'Walrus']
    >>> for s in sent:
    ...     s.lower()
    >>> sent
    ['i', 'am', 'the', 'walrus']

We'll start with the most innocuous operation of all: `assignment`:em:.
Then we will look at sequence types in detail.

.. _sec-assignment:

Assignment
----------

Python's assignment statement operates on `values`:em:.  But what is a value?
Consider the following code fragment:

    >>> word1 = 'Monty'
    >>> word2 = word1              # [_assignment1]
    >>> word1 = 'Python'           # [_assignment2]
    >>> word2
    'Monty'
    
This code shows that when we write ``word2 = word1`` in line assignment1_,
the value of ``word1`` (the string ``'Monty'``) is assigned to ``word2``.
That is, ``word2`` is a `copy`:dt: of ``word1``, so when we overwrite
``word1`` with a new string ``'Python'`` in line assignment2_, the value
of ``word2`` is not affected.

However, assignment statements do not always involve making copies in this way.
An important subtlety of Python is that the "value" of a structured object
(such as a list) is actually a `reference`:em: to the object.  In the
following example, line assignment3_
assigns the reference of ``list1`` to the new variable ``list2``.
When we modify something inside ``list1`` on line assignment4_, we can see
that the contents of ``list2`` have also been changed.

    >>> list1 = ['Monty', 'Python']
    >>> list2 = list1             # [_assignment3]
    >>> list1[1] = 'Bodkin'       # [_assignment4]
    >>> list2
    ['Monty', 'Bodkin']

.. _array-memory:
.. figure:: ../images/array-memory.png
   :scale: 20

   List Assignment and Computer Memory

|nopar|    
Thus line assignment3_ does not copy the contents of the
variable, only its "object reference".
To understand what is going on here, we need to
know how lists are stored in the computer's memory.
In Figure array-memory_, we see that a list ``sent1`` is
a reference to an object stored at location 3133 (which is
itself a series of pointers to other locations holding strings).
When we assign ``sent2 = sent1``, it is just the object reference
3133 that gets copied.

Sequences: Strings, Lists and Tuples
------------------------------------

We have seen three kinds of sequence object: strings, lists, and tuples.
As sequences, they have some common properties: they can be indexed and they have
a length:

    >>> string = 'I turned off the spectroroute'
    >>> words = ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']
    >>> pair = (6, 'turned')
    >>> string[2], words[3], pair[1]
    ('t', 'the', 'turned')
    >>> len(string), len(words), len(pair)
    (29, 5, 2)

|nopar|
We can iterate over the items in a sequence ``s`` in a variety of useful ways,
as shown in Table python-sequence_.

.. table:: python-sequence

   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | Python Expression                           | Comment                                     |
   +=============================================+=============================================+
   | ``for item in s``                           | iterate over the items of ``s``             |
   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ``for item in sorted(s)``                   | iterate over the items of ``s`` in order    |
   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ``for item in set(s)``                      | iterate over unique elements of ``s``       |
   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ``for item in reversed(s)``                 | iterate over elements of ``s`` in reverse   |
   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ``for item in set(s).difference(t)``        | iterate over elements of ``s`` not in ``t`` |
   +---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

   Various ways to iterate over sequences
    

The sequence functions illustrated in Table python-sequence_ can be combined
in various ways; for example, to get unique elements of ``s`` sorted
in reverse, use ``reversed(sorted(set(s)))``.  Sometimes random order
is required: 

    >>> import random
    >>> random.shuffle(words)

We can convert between these sequence types.  For example,
``tuple(s)`` converts any kind of sequence into a tuple, and
``list(s)`` converts any kind of sequence into a list.
We can convert a list of strings to a single string using the
``join()`` function, e.g. ``':'.join(words)``.

Notice in the above code sample that we computed multiple values on a
single line, separated by commas.  These comma-separated expressions
are actually just tuples |mdash| Python allows us to omit the
parentheses around tuples if there is no ambiguity. When we print a
tuple, the parentheses are always displayed. By using tuples in this
way, we are implicitly aggregating items together.

In the next example, we use tuples to re-arrange the
contents of our list.  (We can omit the parentheses
because the comma has higher precedence than assignment.)

    >>> words[2], words[3], words[4] = words[3], words[4], words[2]
    >>> words    
    ['I', 'turned', 'the', 'spectroroute', 'off']

|nopar|
This is an idiomatic and readable way to move items inside a list.
It is equivalent to the following traditional way of doing such
tasks that does not use tuples (notice that this method needs a
temporary variable ``tmp``).

    >>> tmp = words[2]
    >>> words[2] = words[3]
    >>> words[3] = words[4]
    >>> words[4] = tmp

As we have seen, Python has sequence functions such as ``sorted()`` and ``reversed()``
which rearrange the items of a sequence.  There are also functions that
modify the `structure`:em: of a sequence and which can be handy for
language processing.  Thus, ``zip()`` takes
the items of two sequences and 'zips' them together into a single list of pairs.
Given a sequence ``s``, ``enumerate(s)`` returns an iterator that
produces a pair of an index and the item at that index.

    >>> words = ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']
    >>> tags = ['nnp', 'vbd', 'in', 'dt', 'nn']
    >>> zip(words, tags)
    [('I', 'nnp'), ('turned', 'vbd'), ('off', 'in'),
    ('the', 'dt'), ('spectroroute', 'nn')]
    >>> list(enumerate(words))
    [(0, 'I'), (1, 'turned'), (2, 'off'), (3, 'the'), (4, 'spectroroute')]

Combining different sequence types
----------------------------------

Let's combine our knowledge of these three sequence types, together with list
comprehensions, to perform the task of sorting the words in a string by
their length.

    >>> words = 'I turned off the spectroroute'.split()     # [_sequence1]
    >>> wordlens = [(len(word), word) for word in words]    # [_sequence2]
    >>> wordlens
    [(1, 'I'), (6, 'turned'), (3, 'off'), (3, 'the'), (12, 'spectroroute')
    >>> wordlens.sort()                                     # [_sequence3]
    >>> import string
    >>> string.join([word for count, word in wordlens])     # [_sequence4]
    'I off the turned spectroroute'

Each of the above lines of code contains a significant feature.
Line sequence1_ demonstrates that a simple string is actually
an object with methods defined on it, such as ``split()``.
Line sequence2_ shows the construction of a list of tuples,
where each tuple consists of a number (the word length) and the
word, e.g. ``(3, 'the')``.  Line sequence3_ sorts the list,
modifying the list in-place.  Finally, line sequence4_ discards
the length information then joins the words back into a single string.
    
We began by talking about the commonalities in these sequence types,
but the above code illustrates important differences in their
roles.  First, strings appear at the beginning and the end: this is
typical in the context where our program is reading in some text and
producing output for us to read.  Lists and tuples are used in the
middle, but for different purposes.  A list is typically a sequence of
objects all having the `same type`:em:, of `arbitrary length`:em:.  We often
use lists to hold sequences of words.  In contrast,
a tuple is typically a collection of objects of `different types`:em:, of
`fixed length`:em:.  We often use a tuple to hold a `record`:dt:,
a collection of different `fields`:dt: relating to some entity.
This distinction between the use of lists and tuples takes some
getting used to,
so here is another example:

    >>> lexicon = [
    ...     ('the', 'DT', ['Di:', 'D@']),
    ...     ('off', 'IN', ['Qf', 'O:f'])
    ... ]

|nopar| Here, a lexicon is represented as a list because it is a
collection of objects of a single type |mdash| lexical entries |mdash|
of no predetermined length.  An individual entry is represented as a
tuple because it is a collection of objects with different
interpretations, such as the orthographic form, the part of speech,
and the pronunciations represented in the
`SAMPA <http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/index.html>`_ computer
readable phonetic alphabet.  Note that these pronunciations are stored
using a list. (Why?)

The distinction between lists and tuples has been described in terms of
usage.  However, there is a more fundamental difference: in Python,
lists are `mutable`:dt:, while tuples are `immutable`:dt:.  In other
words, lists can be modified, while tuples cannot.  Here are some of
the operations on lists which do in-place modification of the list.
None of these operations is permitted on a tuple, a fact you should
confirm for yourself.

    >>> lexicon.sort()
    >>> lexicon[1] = ('turned', 'VBD', ['t3:nd', 't3`nd'])
    >>> del lexicon[0]

.. _stacks-and-queues:

Stacks and Queues
-----------------

Lists are a particularly versatile data type.  We can use lists to
implement higher-level data types such as stacks and queues.
A `stack`:dt: is a container that has a `first-in-first-out`:dt: policy
for adding and removing items (see Figure stack-queue_).

.. _stack-queue:
.. figure:: ../images/stack-queue.png
   :scale: 30

   Stacks and Queues

Stacks are used to keep track of the current context in
computer processing of natural languages (and programming languages too).
We will seldom have to deal with stacks explicitly, as the implementation
of NLTK parsers, treebank corpus readers, (and even Python functions),
all use stacks behind the scenes.
However, it is important to understand what stacks are and how they work.

.. pylisting:: check-parens
   :caption: Check parentheses are balanced

    def check_parens(tokens):
        stack = []
        for token in tokens:
            if token == '(':     # push
                stack.append(token)
            elif token == ')':   # pop
                stack.pop()
        return stack

    >>> phrase = "( the cat ) ( sat ( on ( the mat )"
    >>> print check_parens(phrase.split())
    ['(', '(']

In Python, we can treat a list as a stack by limiting ourselves to the three
operations defined on stacks: ``append(item)`` (to push ``item`` onto the stack),
``pop()`` to pop the item off the top of the stack, and ``[-1]`` to access the
item on the top of the stack.  Listing check-parens_ processes a sentence with
phrase markers, and checks that the parentheses are balanced.
The loop pushes material onto the stack when it gets an open parenthesis,
and pops the stack when it gets a close parenthesis.
We see that two are left on the stack at the end;
i.e. the parentheses are not balanced.

Although Listing check-parens_ is a useful illustration of stacks,
it is overkill because we could have done a direct count:
``phrase.count('(') == phrase.count(')')``.  However, we
can use stacks for more sophisticated processing of strings
containing nested structure, as shown in Listing convert-parens_.
Here we build a (potentially deeply-nested) list of lists.
Whenever a token other than a parenthesis is encountered,
we add it to a list at the appropriate level of nesting.
The stack cleverly keeps track of this level of nesting, exploiting
the fact that the item at the top of the stack is actually shared with a
more deeply nested item.  (Hint: add diagnostic print statements to
the function to help you see what it is doing.)

.. pylisting:: convert-parens
   :caption: Convert a nested phrase into a nested list using a stack

    def convert_parens(tokens):
        stack = [[]]
        for token in input:
            if token == '(':     # push
                sublist = []
                stack[-1].append(sublist)
                stack.append(sublist)
            elif token == ')':   # pop
                stack.pop()
            else:                # update top of stack
                stack[-1].append(token)
        return stack[0]

    >>> phrase = "( the cat ) ( sat ( on ( the mat ) ) )"
    >>> print convert_parens(phrase.split())
    [['the', 'cat'], ['sat', ['on', ['the', 'mat']]]]    

Lists can be used to represent another important data structure.
A `queue`:dt: is a container that has a `last-in-first-out`:dt: policy
for adding and removing items (see Figure stack-queue_).
Queues are used for scheduling activities or resources.
As with stacks, we will seldom have to deal with queues explicitly,
as the implementation of NLTK n-gram taggers (Section n-gram-taggers_)
and chart parsers (Section chart-parsing_) use queues behind the scenes.
However, we will take a brief look at how queues are implemented using lists.

    >>> queue = ['the', 'cat', 'sat']
    >>> queue.append('on')
    >>> queue.append('the')
    >>> queue.append('mat')
    >>> queue.pop(0)
    'the'
    >>> queue.pop(0)
    'cat'
    >>> queue
    ['sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat']
    
.. _sec-more-list-comprehensions:

More List Comprehensions
------------------------

You may recall that in Chapter chap-words_, we introduced list
comprehensions, with examples like the following:

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> [word.lower() for word in sent]
    ['the', 'dog', 'gave', 'john', 'the', 'newspaper']

List comprehensions are a convenient and readable way to express
list operations in Python, and they have a wide range of uses in natural language
processing.  In this section we will see some more examples.
The first of these takes successive overlapping slices of size
``n`` (a `sliding window`:dt:) from a list
(pay particular attention to the range of the variable ``i``).

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> n = 3
    >>> [sent[i:i+n] for i in range(len(sent)-n+1)]
    [['The', 'dog', 'gave'],
     ['dog', 'gave', 'John'],
     ['gave', 'John', 'the'],
     ['John', 'the', 'newspaper']]

You can also use list comprehensions for a kind of multiplication.
Here we generate all combinations of two determiners, two adjectives, and two nouns.
The list comprehension is split across three lines for readability.

    >>> [(dt,jj,nn) for dt in ('two', 'three')
    ...             for jj in ('old', 'blind')
    ...             for nn in ('men', 'mice')]
    [('two', 'old', 'men'), ('two', 'old', 'mice'), ('two', 'blind', 'men'),
     ('two', 'blind', 'mice'), ('three', 'old', 'men'), ('three', 'old', 'mice'),
     ('three', 'blind', 'men'), ('three', 'blind', 'mice')]

|nopar|
The above example contains three independent ``for`` loops.
These loops have no variables in common, and we could have put them in any order.
We can also have `nested loops`:dt: with shared variables.
The next example iterates over all sentences in a
section of the Brown Corpus, and for each sentence, iterates over each word.

    >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import brown
    >>> [word for sent in brown.raw('a')
    ...     for word in sent
    ...     if len(word) == 17]
    ['September-October', 'Sheraton-Biltmore', 'anti-organization',
     'anti-organization', 'Washington-Oregon', 'York-Pennsylvania',
     'misunderstandings', 'Sheraton-Biltmore', 'neo-stagnationist',
     'cross-examination', 'bronzy-green-gold', 'Oh-the-pain-of-it',
     'Secretary-General', 'Secretary-General', 'textile-importing',
     'textile-exporting', 'textile-producing', 'textile-producing']

|nopar| As you will see, the list comprehension in this example
contains a final ``if`` clause which allows us to filter out any words
that fail to meet the specified condition.

Another way to use loop variables is to ignore them!  This is
the standard method for building multidimensional structures.
For example, to build an array with *m* rows and *n* columns,
where each cell is a set, we would use a nested list comprehension,
as shown in line 2d-array_ below.  Observe that the loop variables
``i`` and ``j`` are not used anywhere in the expressions preceding the
``for`` clauses.

    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> m, n = 3, 7
    >>> array = [[set() for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]     # [_2d-array]
    >>> array[2][5].add('foo')
    >>> pprint(array)
    [[set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([])],
     [set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([])],
     [set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set(['foo']), set([])]]

Sometimes we use a list comprehension as part of a larger aggregation task.
In the following example we calculate the average length of words in part of the Brown Corpus.
Notice that we don't bother storing the list comprehension in a temporary
variable, but use it directly as an argument to the ``average()`` function.

    >>> from numpy import average
    >>> average([len(word) for sent in brown.raw('a') for word in sent])
    4.40154543827

Now that we have reviewed the sequence types, we have one more fundamental data type
to revisit.

Dictionaries
------------

As you have already seen, the dictionary data type can be used in a variety
of language processing tasks (e.g. Section getting-organized_).
However, we have only scratched the surface.
Dictionaries have many more applications than you might have imagined.

.. note:: The dictionary data type is often known by the name
   `associative array`:dt:.  A normal array maps from integers (the keys)
   to arbitrary data types (the values), while an associative array places
   no such constraint on keys.  Keys can be strings, tuples, or other
   more deeply nested structure.  Python places the constraint that
   keys must be `immutable`:idx:.

Let's begin by comparing dictionaries with tuples.  Tuples allow
`access by position`:em:; to access the part-of-speech of the following
lexical entry we just have to know it is found at index position ``1``.
However, dictionaries allow `access by name`:em:\ :

    >>> lexical_entry = ('turned', 'VBD', ['t3:nd', 't3`nd'])
    >>> lexical_entry[1]
    'VBD'
    >>> entry_dict = {'lexeme':'turned', 'pos':'VBD', 'pron':['t3:nd', 't3`nd']}
    >>> entry_dict['pos']
    'VBD'

In this case, dictionaries are little more than a convenience.  We can
even simulate access by name using well-chosen constants, e.g.:

    >>> LEXEME = 0; POS = 1; PRON = 2
    >>> entry_tuple[POS]
    'VBD'

This method works when there is a closed set of keys and the keys are known
in advance.  Dictionaries come into their own when we are mapping from
an open set of keys, which happens when the keys are drawn from an unrestricted
vocabulary or where they are generated by some procedure.  Listing mystery_
illustrates the first of these.  The function ``mystery()``
begins by initializing a dictionary called ``groups``, then populates it
with words.  We leave it as an exercise for the reader to work out what
this function computes.  For now, it's enough to note that the keys of
this dictionary are an open set, and it would not be feasible to use
a integer keys, as would be required if we used lists or tuples for the
representation.

.. TODO: discussion ''.join() vs join()

.. pylisting:: mystery
   :caption: Mystery program

    from string import join
    def mystery(input):
        groups = {}
        for word in input:
            key = join(sorted(list(word)), '')
            if key not in groups:               # [_mystery-key]
                groups[key] = set()             # [_mystery-add]
            groups[key].add(word)               # [_mystery-update]
        return sorted(join(sorted(v)) for v in groups.values() if len(v) > 1)

    >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import words
    >>> text = words.raw()
    >>> print mystery(text)

Listing mystery_ illustrates two important idioms, which we already
touched on in Chapter chap-programming_.  First, dictionary keys
are unique; in order to store multiple items in a single entry we
define the value to be a list or a set, and simply update the value each
time we want to store another item (line mystery-update_).  Second, if a key does
not yet exist in a dictionary (line mystery-key_) we must explicitly add it
and give it an initial value (line mystery-add_).

The second important use of dictionaries is for mappings that involve `compound keys`:dt:.
Suppose we want to categorize a series of linguistic observations according
to two or more properties.  We can combine the properties using a tuple
and build up a dictionary in the usual way, as exemplified in Listing compound-keys_.

.. pylisting:: compound-keys
   :caption: Illustration of compound keys

    from nltk_lite.corpora import ppattach
    attachment = {}
    V, N = 0, 1
    for entry in ppattach.dictionary('training'):
        key = verb, prep
        if key not in attachment:
            attachment[key] = [0,0]
        if entry['attachment'] == 'V':
            attachment[key][V] += 1
        else:
            attachment[key][N] += 1

   a) Now try the same exercise but instead assign ``sent2 = sent1[:]``.
      Modify ``sent1`` again and see what happens to ``sent2``.  Explain.
   b) Now define ``text1`` to be a list of lists of strings (e.g. to
      represent a text consisting of multiple sentences.  Now assign
      ``text2 = text1[:]``, assign a new value to one of the words,
      e.g. ``text1[1][1] = 'Monty'``.  Check what this did to ``text2``.
      Explain.
   c) Load Python's ``deepcopy()`` function (i.e. ``from copy import deepcopy``),
      consult its documentation, and test that it makes a fresh copy of any
      object.

#. |soso| Write code which starts with a string of words and
   results in a new string consisting of the same words, but where
   the first word swaps places with the second, and so on. For
   example, ``'the cat sat on the mat'`` will be converted into ``'cat
   the on sat mat the'``.

#. |soso| Initialize an *n*\ -by-*m* list of lists of empty strings using list
   multiplication, e.g. ``word_table = [[''] * n] * m``.  What happens
   when you set one of its values, e.g. ``word_table[1][2] = "hello"``?
   Explain why this happens.  Now write an expression using ``range()``
   to construct a list of lists, and show that it does not have this problem.

#. |soso| Write code to initialize a two-dimensional array of sets called
   ``word_vowels`` and process a list of words, adding each
   word to ``word_vowels[l][v]`` where ``l`` is the length of the word and ``v`` is
   the number of vowels it contains.

#. |soso| Write code that builds a dictionary of dictionaries of sets.

#. |soso| Use ``sorted()`` and ``set()`` to get a sorted list of tags used in the Brown
   corpus, removing duplicates.

#. |hard| Extend the example in Listing compound-keys_ in the following ways:

   a) Define two sets ``verbs`` and ``preps``, and add each verb and preposition
      as they are encountered.  (Note that you can add an item to a set without
      bothering to check whether it is already present.)

   b) Create nested loops to display the results, iterating over verbs and
      prepositions in sorted order.  Generate one line of output per verb,
      listing prepositions and attachment ratios as follows:
      ``raised: about 0:3, at 1:0, by 9:0, for 3:6, from 5:0, in 5:5...``

   c) We used a tuple to represent a compound key consisting of two strings.
      However, we could have simply concatenated the strings, e.g.
      ``key = verb + ":" + prep``, resulting in a simple string key.
      Why is it better to use tuples for compound keys?

------------------
Presenting Results
------------------

Often we write a program to report a single datum, such as a particular element
in a corpus that meets some complicated criterion, or a single summary statistic
such as a word-count or the performance of a tagger.  More often, we write a program
to produce a structured result, such as a tabulation of numbers or linguistic forms,
or a reformatting of the original data.  When the results to be presented are linguistic,
textual output is usually the most natural choice.  However, when the results are numerical,
it may be preferrable to produce graphical output.  In this section you will learn about
a variety of ways to present program output.

Strings and Formats
-------------------

We have seen that there are two ways to display the contents of an object:

    >>> word = 'cat'
    >>> sentence = """hello
    ... world"""
    >>> print word
    cat
    >>> print sentence
    hello
    world
    >>> word
    'cat'
    >>> sentence
    'hello\nworld'

The ``print`` command yields Python's attempt to produce the most human-readable form of an object.
The second method |mdash| naming the variable at a prompt |mdash| shows us a string
that can be used to recreate this object.  It is important to keep in mind that both of
these are just strings, displayed for the benefit of you, the user.  They do not give
us any clue as to the actual internal representation of the object.

There are many other useful ways to display an object as a string of
characters.  This may be for the benefit of a human reader, or because
we want to `export`:dt: our data to a particular file format for use
in an external program.

Formatted output typically contains a combination of variables and
pre-specified strings, e.g. given a dictionary ``wordcount``
consisting of words and their frequencies we could do:

    >>> wordcount = {'cat':3, 'dog':4, 'snake':1}
    >>> for word in wordcount:
    ...     print word, '->', wordcount[word], ';',
    dog -> 4 ; cat -> 3 ; snake -> 1

Apart from the problem of unwanted whitespace, print statements
that contain alternating variables and constants can be difficult to read and
maintain.  A better solution is to use print formatting strings:

    >>> for word in wordcount:
    ...    print '%s->%d;' % (word, wordcount[word]),
    dog->4; cat->3; snake->1
    
.. TODO: describe textwrap package
    
.. _sec-lining-things-up:

Lining things up
----------------

So far our formatting strings have contained specifications of fixed width, such
as ``%6s``, a string that is padded to width 6 and right-justified.
We can include a minus sign to make it left-justified.
In case we don't know in advance how wide a displayed value should be,
the width value can be replaced with a star in the formatting string,
then specified using a variable:

    >>> '%6s' % 'dog'
    '   dog'
    >>> '%-6s' % 'dog'
    'dog   '
    >>> width = 6
    >>> '%-*s' % (width, 'dog')
    'dog   '

Other control characters are used for decimal integers and floating point numbers.
Since the percent character ``%`` has a special interpretation in formatting strings,
we have to precede it with another ``%`` to get it in the output:

    >>> "accuracy for %d words: %2.4f%%" % (9375, 100.0 * 3205/9375)
    'accuracy for 9375 words: 34.1867%'

An important use of formatting strings is for tabulating data.
The program in Listing modal-tabulate_ iterates over five genres of the Brown Corpus.
For each token having the ``md`` tag we increment a count.  To do this we
have used ``ConditionalFreqDist()``, where the condition is the current genre
and the event is the modal, i.e. this constructs a frequency distribution of
the modal verbs in each genre.
Line modals-of-interest_
identifies a small set of modals of interest, and calls
the function ``tabulate()`` which
processes the data structure to output the required counts.
Note that we have been careful to separate the language processing
from the tabulation of results.

.. pylisting:: modal-tabulate
   :caption: Frequency of Modals in Different Sections of the Brown Corpus

    from nltk_lite.probability import ConditionalFreqDist
    def count_words_by_tag(t, genres):
        cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist()
        for genre in genres:                       # each genre
            for sent in brown.tagged(genre):       # each sentence
                for (word,tag) in sent:            # each tagged token
                    if tag == t:                   # found a word tagged t
                         cfdist[genre].inc(word.lower())
        return cfdist

    def tabulate(cfdist, words):
        print '%-18s' % 'Genre', string.join([('%6s' % w) for w in words])
        for genre in cfdist.conditions():               # for each genre
            print '%-18s' % brown.item_name[genre],     # print row heading

            print                                       # end the row

    >>> genres = ['a', 'd', 'e', 'h', 'n']
    >>> cfdist = count_words_by_tag('md', genres)
    >>> modals = ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']   # [_modals-of-interest]
    >>> tabulate(cfdist, modals)
    Genre                 can  could    may  might   must   will

    fiction: adventure     48    154      6     58     27     48

There are some interesting patterns in the table produced by
Listing modal-tabulate_.  For instance,
compare the rows for government literature and adventure literature;
the former is dominated by the use of ``can, may, must, will`` while
the latter is characterised by the use of ``could`` and ``might``.
With some further work it might be possible to guess the genre of a
new text automatically, according to its distribution of modals.

Our next example, in Listing concordance_, generates a concordance display.
We use the left/right justification of strings and the variable width
to get vertical alignment of a variable-width window.

Writing results to a file
-------------------------

We have seen how to read text from files (Section reading-files_).
It is often useful to write output to files as well.  The following
code opens a file ``output.txt`` for writing, and saves the program
output to the file.

    >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import genesis
    >>> file = open('output.txt', 'w')
    >>> words = set(genesis.raw())
    >>> words.sort()
    >>> for word in words:
    ...     file.write(word + "\n")

When we write non-text data to a file we must convert it to a string first.
We can do this conversion using formatting strings, as we saw above.
We can also do it using Python's backquote notation, which converts any
object into a string.  Let's write the total number of words to our
file, before closing it.

    >>> len(words)
    4408
    >>> `len(words)`
    '4408'
    >>> file.write(`len(words)` + "\n")
    >>> file.close()

.. _sec-graphics:

Graphical presentation
----------------------

So far we have focussed on textual presentation and the use of formatted print
statements to get output lined up in columns.  It is often very useful to display
numerical data in graphical form, since this often makes it easier to detect
patterns.  For example, in Listing modal-tabulate_ we saw a table of numbers
showing the frequency of particular modal verbs in the Brown Corpus, classified
by genre.  In Listing modal-plot_ we present the same information in graphical
format.  The output is shown in Figure modal-genre_ (a color figure in the online version).

.. Note:: Listing modal-plot_ uses the PyLab package which supports sophisticated
   plotting functions with a MATLAB-style interface.  For more information about
   this package please see ``http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/``.

   Bar Chart Showing Frequency of Modals in Different Sections of Brown Corpus

From the bar chart it is immediately obvious that `may`:lx: and `must`:lx: have
almost identical relative frequencies.  The same goes for `could`:lx: and `might`:lx:.

Functions
---------

Once you have been programming for a while, you will find that you need
to perform a task that you have done in the past.  In fact, over time,
the number of completely novel things you have to do in creating a program
decreases significantly.  Half of the work may involve simple tasks that
you have done before.  Thus it is important for your code to be `re-usable`:em:.
One effective way to do this is to abstract commonly used sequences of steps
into a `function`:dt:, as we briefly saw in Chapter chap-programming_.

For example, suppose we find that we often want to read text from an HTML file.
This involves several steps: opening the file, reading it in, normalizing
whitespace, and stripping HTML markup.  We can collect these steps into a
function, and give it a name such as ``get_text()``:

.. pylisting:: get_text
   :caption: Read text from a file

     import re
     def get_text(file):
         """Read text from a file, normalizing whitespace
         and stripping HTML markup."""
         text = open(file).read()
         text = re.sub('\s+', ' ', text)
         text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', ' ', text)
         return text

Now, any time we want to get cleaned-up text from an HTML file, we can just call
``get_text()`` with the name of the file as its only argument.  It will return
a string, and we can assign this to a variable, e.g.:
``contents = get_text("test.html")``.  Each time we want to use this series of
steps we only have to call the function.

Notice that a function consists of the keyword ``def`` (short for "define"), followed
by the function name, followed by a sequence of parameters enclosed in parentheses, then
a colon.  The following lines contain an indented block of code, the `function body`:dt:.

Using functions has the benefit of saving space in our program.  More
importantly, our choice of name for the function helps make the program *readable*.
In the case of the above example, whenever our program needs to read cleaned-up
text from a file we don't have to clutter the program with four lines of code, we
simply need to call ``get_text()``.  This naming helps to provide some "semantic
interpretation" |mdash| it helps a reader of our program to see what the program "means".

Notice that the above function definition contains a string.  The first string inside
a function definition is called a `docstring`:dt:.  Not only does it document the
purpose of the function to someone reading the code, it is accessible to a programmer
who has loaded the code from a file:

    >>> help(get_text)
    get_text(file)
        Read text from a file, normalizing whitespace and stripping HTML markup

We have seen that functions help to make our work reusable and readable.  They
also help make it *reliable*.  When we re-use code that has already been developed
and tested, we can be more confident that it handles a variety of cases correctly.
We also remove the risk that we forget some important step, or introduce a bug.
The program which calls our function also has increased reliability.  The author
of that program is dealing with a shorter program, and its components behave
transparently.

* [More: overview of section]

Function arguments
------------------

* multiple arguments
* named arguments
* default values

Python is a `dynamically typed`:dt: language.  It does not force us to
declare the type of a variable when we write a program.  This feature
is often useful, as it permits us to define functions that are flexible
about the type of their arguments.  For example, a tagger might expect
a sequence of words, but it wouldn't care whether this sequence is expressed
as a list, a tuple, or an iterator.

However, often we want to write programs for later use by others, and want
to program in a defensive style, providing useful warnings when functions
have not been invoked correctly.  Observe that the ``tag()``
function in Listing tag1_ behaves sensibly for string arguments,
but that it does not complain when it is passed a dictionary.

.. pylisting:: tag1
   :caption: A tagger which tags anything

    def tag(word):
        if word in ['a', 'the', 'all']:
            return 'dt'
        else:
            return 'nn'

    >>> tag('the')
    'dt'
    >>> tag('dog')
    'nn'
    >>> tag({'lexeme':'turned', 'pos':'VBD', 'pron':['t3:nd', 't3`nd']})
    'nn'

It would be helpful if the author of this function took some extra steps to
ensure that the ``word`` parameter of the ``tag()`` function is a string.
A naive approach would be to check the type of the argument and return
a diagnostic value, such as Python's special empty value, ``None``,
as shown in Listing tag2_.

.. pylisting:: tag2
   :caption: A tagger which only tags strings

    def tag(word):
        if not type(word) is str:
            return None
        if word in ['a', 'the', 'all']:
            return 'dt'
        else:
            return 'nn'

However, this approach is dangerous because the calling program
may not detect the error, and the diagnostic return value may be
propagated to later parts of the program with unpredictable consequences.
A better solution is shown in Listing tag3_.

.. pylisting:: tag3
   :caption: A tagger which generates an error message when not passed a string

    def tag(word):
        if not type(word) is str:
            raise ValueError, "argument to tag() must be a string"
        if word in ['a', 'the', 'all']:
            return 'dt'
        else:
            return 'nn'

This produces an error that cannot be ignored, since it halts program execution.
Additionally, the error message is easy to interpret.  (We will see an even
better approach, known as "duck typing" in Chapter chap-advanced-programming_.)

Another aspect of defensive programming concerns the return statement of a function.
In order to be confident that all execution paths through a function lead to a
return statement, it is best to have a single return statement at the end of
the function definition.
This approach has a further benefit: it makes it more likely that the
function will only return a single type.
Thus, the following version of our ``tag()`` function is safer:

    >>> def tag(word):
    ...     result = 'nn'                       # default value, a string
    ...     if word in ['a', 'the', 'all']:     # in certain cases...
    ...         result = 'dt'                   #   overwrite the value
    ...     return result                       # all paths end here

A return statement can be used to pass multiple values back to the calling
program, by packing them into a tuple.
Here we define a function that returns a tuple
consisting of the average word length of a sentence, and the inventory
of letters used in the sentence.  It would have been clearer to write
two separate functions.

.. EK: wouldn't it be better to use an example which isn't then open to criticism?

    >>> def proc_words(words):
    ...     avg_wordlen = sum(len(word) for word in words)/len(words)
    ...     chars_used = ''.join(sorted(set(''.join(words))))
    ...     return avg_wordlen, chars_used
    >>> proc_words(words)
    (5, 'Icdefhnoprstu')
    
Of course, functions do not need to have a return statement at all.
Some functions do their work as a side effect, printing a result,
modifying a file, or updating the contents of a parameter to the function.
Consider the following three sort functions; the last approach is dangerous
because a programmer could use it without realizing that it had modified
its input.

    >>> def my_sort1(l):      # good: modifies its argument, no return value
    ...     l.sort()
    >>> def my_sort2(l):      # good: doesn't touch its argument, returns value
    ...     return sorted(l)
    >>> def my_sort3(l):      # bad: modifies its argument and also returns it
    ...     l.sort()
    ...     return l

An Important Subtlety
---------------------

Back in Section sec-assignment_ you saw that in Python, assignment works on values,
but that the value of a structured object is a reference to that object.  The same
is true for functions.  Python interprets function parameters as values (this is
known as `call-by-value`:dt:).  Consider Listing call-by-value_.
Function ``set_up()`` has two parameters,
both of which are modified inside the function.  We begin by assigning an empty string
to ``w`` and an empty dictionary to ``p``.  After calling the function, ``w`` is unchanged,
while ``p`` is changed:

.. pylisting:: call-by-value

    def set_up(word, properties):
        word = 'cat'
        properties['pos'] = 'noun'

    >>> w = ''
    >>> p = {}
    >>> set_up(w, p)
    >>> w
    ''
    >>> p
    {'pos': 'noun'}

To understand why ``w`` was not changed, it is necessary to understand call-by-value.
When we called ``set_up(w, p)``, the value of ``w`` (an empty string) was assigned to
a new variable ``word``.  Inside the function, the value of ``word`` was modified.
However, that had no affect on the external value of ``w``.  This parameter passing is
identical to the following sequence of assignments:

    >>> w = ''
    >>> word = w
    >>> word = 'cat'
    >>> w
    ''

|nopar|
In the case of the structured object, matters are quite different.
When we called ``set_up(w, p)``, the value of ``p`` (an empty
dictionary) was assigned to a new local variable ``properties``.  Since the
value of ``p`` is an object reference, both variables now reference the same
memory location.  Modifying something inside ``properties`` will also
change ``p``, just as if we had done the following sequence of assignments:
 
    >>> p = {}
    >>> properties = p
    >>> properties['pos'] = 'noun'
    >>> p
    {'pos': 'noun'}

Thus, to understand Python's call-by-value parameter passing,
it is enough to understand Python's assignment operation.
We will address some closely related issues in our later discussion
of variable scope (Section sec-variable-scope_).

Functional Decomposition
------------------------

Well-structured programs usually make extensive use of functions.
When a block of program code grows longer than 10-20 lines, it is a
great help to readability if the code is broken up into one or more
functions, each one having a clear purpose.  This is analogous to
the way a good essay is divided into paragraphs, each expressing one main idea.

Functions provide an important kind of *abstraction*.
They allow us to group multiple actions into a single, complex action,
and associate a name with it.
(Compare this with the way we combine the actions of
`go`:lx: and `bring back`:lx: into a single more complex action `fetch`:lx:.)
When we use functions, the main program can be written at a higher level
of abstraction, making its structure transparent, e.g.

    >>> data = load_corpus()
    >>> results = analyze(data)
    >>> present(results)

Appropriate use of functions makes programs more readable and maintainable.
Additionally, it becomes possible to reimplement a function
|mdash| replacing the function's body with more efficient code |mdash|
without having to be concerned with the rest of the program.

Consider the ``freq_words`` function in Listing freq-words1_.
It updates the contents of a frequency distribution that is
passed in as a parameter, and it also prints a list of the
`n`:math: most frequent words.

.. pylisting:: freq-words1

    def freq_words(url, freqdist, n):
        from nltk_lite.corpora import web
        for word in web.raw(url):
            freqdist.inc(word.lower())
        print freqdist.sorted()[:n]

    >>> constitution = "http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution_transcript.html"
    >>> from nltk_lite.probability import FreqDist
    >>> fd = FreqDist()
    >>> freq_words(constitution, fd, 20)
    ['the', ',', 'of', 'and', 'shall', '.', 'be', 'to', 'in', 'states', 'or',
    ';', 'united', 'a', 'state', 'by', 'for', 'any', 'president', 'which']

This function has a number of problems.
The function has two side-effects: it modifies the contents of its second
parameter, and it prints a selection of the results it has computed.
The function would be easier to understand and to reuse elsewhere if we
initialize the ``FreqDist()`` object inside the function (in the same place
it is populated), and if we moved the selection and display of results to the
calling program.  In Listing freq-words2_ we `refactor`:dt: this function,
and simplify its interface by providing a single ``url`` parameter.

.. pylisting:: freq-words2

    def freq_words(url):
        from nltk_lite.corpora import web
        from nltk_lite.probability import FreqDist
        freqdist = FreqDist()
        for word in web.raw(url):
            freqdist.inc(word.lower())
        return freqdist

    >>> fd = freq_words(constitution)
    >>> print fd.sorted()[:20]
    ['the', ',', 'of', 'and', 'shall', '.', 'be', 'to', 'in', 'states', 'or',
    ';', 'united', 'a', 'state', 'by', 'for', 'any', 'president', 'which']

.. _functions-as-arguments:

Functions as Arguments
----------------------

So far the arguments we have passed into functions have been simple objects like
strings, or structured objects like lists.  These arguments allow us to parameterise
the behavior of a function.  As a result, functions are very flexible and powerful
abstractions, permitting us to repeatedly apply the `same operation`:em: on `different data`:em:.
Python also lets us pass a function as
an argument to another function.  Now we can abstract out the operation, and apply
a `different operation`:em: on the `same data`:em:.  As the following examples show,
we can pass the built-in function ``len()`` or a user-defined function ``last_letter()``
as parameters to another function:

    >>> def extract_property(prop):
    ...     words = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    ...     return [prop(word) for word in words]
    >>> extract_property(len)
    [3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 9]
    >>> def last_letter(word):
    ...     return word[-1]
    >>> extract_property(last_letter)
    ['e', 'g', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'r']
    
Surprisingly, ``len`` and ``last_letter`` are objects that can be
passed around like lists and dictionaries.  Notice that parentheses
are only used after a function name if we are invoking the function;
when we are simply passing the function around as an object these are
not used.

Python provides us with one more way to define functions as arguments
to other functions, so-called `lambda expressions`:dt:.  Supposing there
was no need to use the above ``last_letter()`` function in multiple places,
we can equivalently write the following:
    
    >>> extract_property(lambda w: w[-1])
    ['e', 'g', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'r']
    
Our next example illustrates passing a function to the ``sorted()`` function.
When we call the latter with a single argument (the list to be sorted),
it uses the built-in lexicographic comparison function ``cmp()``.
However, we can supply our own sort function, e.g. to sort by decreasing
length.

    >>> words = 'I turned off the spectroroute'.split()
    >>> sorted(words)
    ['I', 'off', 'spectroroute', 'the', 'turned']
    >>> sorted(words, cmp)
    ['I', 'off', 'spectroroute', 'the', 'turned']
    >>> sorted(words, lambda x, y: cmp(len(y), len(x)))
    ['spectroroute', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'I']

In sec-more-list-comprehensions_ we saw an example of filtering out
some items in a list comprehension, using an ``if`` test.
Similarly, we can restrict a list to just the lexical words, using
``[word for word in sent if is_lexical(word)]``.  This is a little cumbersome
as it mentions the ``word`` variable three times.  A more compact way to express
the same thing is as follows.

    >>> def is_lexical(word):
    ...     return word.lower() not in ('a', 'an', 'the', 'that', 'to')
    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> filter(is_lexical, sent)
    ['dog', 'gave', 'John', 'newspaper']

|nopar| The function ``is_lexical(word)`` returns ``True`` just in case
``word``, when normalized to lowercase, is not in the given list.
This function is itself used as an argument to ``filter()``;
in Python, functions are just another kind of object that can be passed around a program;
we will return to this in Section functions-as-arguments_.
The ``filter()`` function applies its first argument (a function) to each
item of its second (a sequence), only passing it through if the
function returns true for that item.  Thus ``filter(f, seq)`` is
equivalent to ``[item for item in seq if apply(f,item) == True]``.

Another helpful function, which like ``filter()`` applies a function
to a sequence, is ``map()``.  Here is a simple
way to find the average length of a sentence in a section of the Brown Corpus:

    >>> average(map(len, brown.raw('a')))
    21.7461072664

|nopar|
Instead of ``len()``, we could have passed in any other function we liked:

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> def is_vowel(letter):
    ...     return letter in "AEIOUaeiou"
    >>> def vowelcount(word):
    ...     return len(filter(is_vowel, word))
    >>> map(vowelcount, sent)
    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3]

|nopar|
Instead of using ``filter()`` to call a named function ``is_vowel``, we can
define a lambda expression as follows:

    >>> map(lambda w: len(filter(lambda c: c in "AEIOUaeiou", w)), sent)
    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3]

Exercises
---------

#. |easy| Review the answers that you gave for the exercises in sec-back-to-the-basics_,
   and rewrite the code as one or more functions.

#. |soso| In this section we saw examples of some special functions such as ``filter()`` and
   ``map()``.  Other functions in this family are ``zip()`` and ``reduce()``.
   Find out what these do, and write some code to try them out.
   What uses might they have in language processing?

#. |soso| Write a function that takes a list of words (containing duplicates) and
   returns a list of words (with no duplicates) sorted by decreasing frequency.
   E.g. if the input list contained 10 instances of the word ``table`` and 9 instances
   of the word ``chair``, then ``table`` would appear before ``chair`` in the output
   list.
   
#. |soso| As you saw, ``zip()`` combines two lists into a single list
   of pairs. What happens when the lists are of unequal lengths?
   Define a function ``myzip()`` which does something different with
   unequal lists.
   
#. |soso| Import the ``itemgetter()`` function from the ``operator`` module in Python's
   standard library (i.e. ``from operator import itemgetter``).  Create a list
   ``words`` containing several words.  Now try calling:
   ``sorted(words, key=itemgetter(1))``, and ``sorted(words, key=itemgetter(-1))``.
   Explain what ``itemgetter()`` is doing.

.. _sec-algorithm-design-strategies:

---------------------------
Algorithm Design Strategies
---------------------------

A major part of algorithmic problem solving is selecting or adapting
an appropriate algorithm for the problem at hand.  Whole books are written
on this topic (e.g. [Levitin2004]_) and we only have space to introduce
some key concepts and elaborate on the approaches that are most prevalent
in natural language processing.

The best known strategy is known as `divide-and-conquer`:dt:.
We attack a problem of size *n* by dividing it into two problems of size *n/2*,
solve these problems, and combine their results into a solution of the original problem.
Figure mergesort_ illustrates this approach for sorting a list of words.

.. _mergesort:
.. figure:: ../images/mergesort.png
   :scale: 35

   Sorting by Divide-and-Conquer (Mergesort)

Another strategy is `decrease-and-conquer`:dt:.  In this approach, a small amount
of work on a problem of size *n* permits us to reduce it to a problem of
size *n/2*.  Figure binary-search_ illustrates this approach for the problem
of finding the index of an item in a sorted list.
   
.. _binary-search:
.. figure:: ../images/binary-search.png
   :scale: 35

   Searching by Decrease-and-Conquer (Binary Search)
   
A third well-known strategy is `transform-and-conquer`:dt:.  We attack a problem
by transforming it into an instance of a problem we already know how to solve.
For example, in order to detect duplicates entries in a list, we can `pre-sort`:dt:
the list, then look for adjacent identical items, as shown in Listing presorting_.
Our approach to n-gram chunking in Section n-gram-chunking_ is another case of
transform and conquer (why?).

.. pylisting:: presorting
   :caption: Presorting a list for duplicate detection

    def duplicates(words):
        prev = None
        dup = []
        for word in sorted(words):
            if word == prev:
                dup.append(word)
            else:
                prev = word
        return dup
    
    >>> duplicates(['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'pig', 'dog', 'cat', 'ant', 'cat'])
    ['cat', 'dog']        

Recursion (notes)
-----------------

We first saw recursion in Chapter chap-words_, in a function that navigated
the hypernym hierarchy of WordNet...

Iterative solution:

    >>> def factorial(n):
    ...     result = 1
    ...     for i in range(n+1):
    ...         result *= i
    ...     return result

Recursive solution (base case, induction step)

    >>> def factorial(n):
    ...     if n == 1:
    ...         return n
    ...     else:
    ...         return n * factorial(n-1)

[Simple example of recursion on strings.]

Generating all permutations of words, to check which ones are
grammatical:

    >>> def perms(seq):
    ...     if len(seq) <= 1:
    ...         yield seq
    ...     else:
    ...         for perm in perms(seq[1:]):
    ...             for i in range(len(perm)+1):
    ...                 yield perm[:i] + seq[0:1] + perm[i:]
    >>> list(perms(['police', 'fish', 'cream']))
    [['police', 'fish', 'cream'], ['fish', 'police', 'cream'],
     ['fish', 'cream', 'police'], ['police', 'cream', 'fish'],
     ['cream', 'police', 'fish'], ['cream', 'fish', 'police']]

Deeply Nested Objects (notes)
-----------------------------

We can use recursive functions to build deeply-nested objects.
Building a letter trie, Listing trie_.

.. pylisting:: trie
   :caption: Building a Letter Trie

    def insert(trie, key, value):
        if key:
            first, rest = key[0], key[1:]
            if first not in trie:
                trie[first] = {}
            insert(trie[first], rest, value)
        else:
            trie['value'] = value

    >>> trie = {}
    >>> insert(trie, 'chat', 'cat')
    >>> insert(trie, 'chien', 'dog')
    >>> trie['c']['h']
    {'a': {'t': {'value': 'cat'}}, 'i': {'e': {'n': {'value': 'dog'}}}}
    >>> trie['c']['h']['a']['t']['value']
    'cat'
    >>> pprint(trie)
    {'c': {'h': {'a': {'t': {'value': 'cat'}},
                 'i': {'e': {'n': {'value': 'dog'}}}}}}


.. _sec-dynamic-programming:

Dynamic Programming
-------------------

Dynamic programming is a general technique for designing algorithms
which is widely used in natural language processing.  The term
'programming' is used in a different sense to what you might expect,
to mean planning or scheduling.  Dynamic programming is used when a
problem contains overlapping sub-problems.  Instead of computing
solutions to these sub-problems repeatedly, we simply store them in a
lookup table.
In the remainder of this section we will introduce dynamic programming,
but in a rather different context to syntactic parsing.

Pingala was an Indian author who lived around the 5th century B.C.,
and wrote a treatise on Sanscrit prosody called the *Chandas Shastra*.
Virahanka extended this work around the 6th century A.D., studying the
number of ways of combining short and long syllables to create a meter
of length *n*.  He found, for example, that there are five ways to
construct a meter of length 4: *V*\ :subscript:`4` = *{LL, SSL, SLS,
LSS, SSSS}*.  Observe that we can split *V*\ :subscript:`4` into two
subsets, those starting with *L* and those starting with
*S*, as shown in v4_.


.. _v4:
.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::
   
    *V*\ :subscript:`4` =
      LL, LSS
        i.e. L prefixed to each item of *V*\ :subscript:`2` = {L, SS}
      SSL, SLS, SSSS
        i.e. S prefixed to each item of *V*\ :subscript:`3` = {SL, LS, SSS}

.. pylisting:: virahanka
   :caption: Three Ways to Compute Sansrit Meter

    def virahanka1(n):
        if n == 0:
            return [""]
        elif n == 1:
            return ["S"]
        else:
            s = ["S" + prosody for prosody in virahanka1(n-1)]
            l = ["L" + prosody for prosody in virahanka1(n-2)]
            return s + l
            
    def virahanka2(n):
        lookup = [[""], ["S"]]
        for i in range(n-1):
            s = ["S" + prosody for prosody in lookup[i+1]]
            l = ["L" + prosody for prosody in lookup[i]]
            lookup.append(s + l)
        return lookup[n]

    def virahanka3(n, lookup={0:[""], 1:["S"]}):
        if n not in lookup:
            s = ["S" + prosody for prosody in virahanka3(n-1)]
            l = ["L" + prosody for prosody in virahanka3(n-2)]
            lookup[n] = s + l
        return lookup[n]
            
    >>> virahanka1(4)
    ['SSSS', 'SSL', 'SLS', 'LSS', 'LL']  
    >>> virahanka2(4)
    ['SSSS', 'SSL', 'SLS', 'LSS', 'LL']  
    >>> virahanka3(4)
    ['SSSS', 'SSL', 'SLS', 'LSS', 'LL']  

|nopar| 
With this observation, we can write a little recursive function called
``virahanka1()`` to compute these meters, shown in Listing virahanka_.
Notice that, in order to compute *V*\ :subscript:`4` we first compute
*V*\ :subscript:`3` and *V*\ :subscript:`2`.  But to compute *V*\ :subscript:`3`,
we need to first compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` and *V*\ :subscript:`1`.  This `call
structure`:dt: is depicted in call-structure_.

.. _call-structure:
.. ex:: 
   .. tree:: (V4 (V3 (V2 V1 V0) V1) (V2 V1 V0))

|nopar| 
As you can see, *V*\ :subscript:`2` is computed twice.
This might not seem like a significant problem, but 
it turns out to be rather wasteful as *n* gets large:
to compute *V*\ :subscript:`20` using this recursive technique, we
would compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` 4,181 times;
and for *V*\ :subscript:`40` we would compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` 63,245,986 times!
A much better alternative is to store the value of *V*\ :subscript:`2` in a table
and look it up whenever we need it.  The same goes for other values, such
as *V*\ :subscript:`3` and so on.  Function ``virahanka2()`` implements a
dynamic programming approach to the problem.  It works by filling up a
table (called ``lookup``) with solutions to *all* smaller instances of the
problem, stopping as soon as we reach the value we're interested in.
At this point we read off the value and return it.  Crucially, each
sub-problem is only ever solved once.

Notice that the approach taken in ``virahanka2()`` is to solve smaller
problems on the way to solving larger problems.  Accordingly, this is known as the
`bottom-up`:dt: approach to dynamic programming.  Unfortunately it turns out
to be quite wasteful for some applications, since it
may compute solutions to sub-problems that are never required for
solving the main problem.  This wasted computation can be avoided
using the `top-down`:dt: approach to dynamic programming, which is
illustrated in the function ``virahanka3()`` in Listing virahanka_.
Unlike the bottom-up approach, this approach is recursive.  It avoids
the huge wastage of ``virahanka1()`` by checking whether it has
previously stored the result.  If not, it computes the result
recursively and stores it in the table.  The last step is to return
the stored result.

This concludes our brief introduction to dynamic programming.
We will encounter it again in Chapter chap-advanced-parsing_.

.. note:: Dynamic programming is a kind of `memoization`:dt:.
   A memoized function stores results of previous calls to the
   function along with the supplied parameters.  If the function is
   subsequently called with those parameters, it returns the
   stored result instead of recalculating it.

.. _sec-timing:

Timing (notes)
--------------

We can easily test the efficiency gains made by the use of dynamic programming,
or any other putative performance enhancement, using the ``timeit`` module:

    >>> from timeit import Timer
    >>> Timer("PYTHON CODE", "INITIALIZATION CODE").timeit()

Exercises
---------

#. |soso| Write a recursive function ``lookup(trie, key)`` that looks up a key in a trie,
   and returns the value it finds.  Extend the function to return a word when it is uniquely
   determined by its prefix (e.g. ``vanguard`` is the only word which starts with ``vang-``,
   so ``lookup(trie, 'vang')`` should return the same thing as ``lookup(trie, 'vanguard')``).

#. |soso| Read about string edit distance and the Levenshtein Algorithm.
   Try the implementation provided in ``nltk_lite.utilities.edit_dist()``.
   How is this using dynamic programming?  Does it use the bottom-up or
   top-down approach?

#. |soso| The Catalan numbers arise in many applications of combinatorial mathematics,
   including the counting of parse trees (Chapter chap-advanced-parsing_).  The series
   can be defined as follows: C\ :subscript:`0` = 1, and
   C\ :subscript:`n+1` = |Sigma|\ :subscript:`0..n` (C\ :subscript:`i`\ C\ :subscript:`n-i`).

   a) Write a recursive function to compute `n`:math:\ th Catalan number C\ :subscript:`n`
   
   b) Now write another function that does this computation using dynamic programming
   
   c) Use the ``timeit`` module to compare the performance of these functions as `n`:math:
      increases.
