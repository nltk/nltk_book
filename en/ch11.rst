Introduction
------------

So far, this book has concentrated on relatively concrete aspects of
language, particularly on words, and the patterns in which they
occur. In the area of `syntax`:em:, we have studied the organization of
words into parts of speech, and from there we moved on to how
sequences of words are built up to make phrases and sentences. 

By contrast, we have said relatively little about `semantics`:dt:,
that is, about how language is used to convey meanings. However,
meaning is a very slippery notion, and there is much debate and
disagreement about what is involved in a computational model of
linguistic meaning. In this chapter, we will concentrate on one
particular approach to semantics, but at various points we shall
try to indicate alternative perspectives.

In order to pin down 'the meaning of meaning' more closely, let's
suppose that you are a native speaker of English, and have started to
learn German. I ask if you understand what ex-sem1_ means:

.. _ex-sem1:
.. ex::
   Die Kamera gef\ |aumlaut|\ llt Stefan. 

If you know the meanings of the individual words in ex-sem1_, and know
how these meanings are combined to make up the meaning of the whole
sentence, you might say that ex-sem1_ means the same as ex-sem21_, or
more idiomatically, ex-sem22_:

.. _ex-sem2:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-sem21:
   .. ex::
      The camera pleases Stefan.

   .. _ex-sem22:
   .. ex::
      Stefan likes the camera.
   

Now, I most will likely take this as evidence that you do grasp the meaning
of ex-sem1_. But isn't this because you have 
translated from one language, German, into another, namely English? If I
didn't already understand English, we would be no further forward! Nevertheless,
there are some important insights here, ones that we will return to shortly.

Here's another way of looking at things. Imagine there is a situation
*s* where there are two entities, Stefan and a specific camera, say
Agfa Isola Serial No. KX7750. In addition, there is a relation holding between the two
entities, which we will call the *please* relation. If you understand the
meaning of ex-sem1_, then you know that it is true in situation
*s*. In part, you know this because you know that `Die Kamera`:lx:
refers to Agfa Isola Serial No. KX7750, `Stefan`:lx: refers
to Stefan, and `gef\ |aumlaut|\ llt`:lx: refers to the *please*
relation. You also know that the grammatical subject of `gef\ |aumlaut|\ llt`:lx:
plays the role of the entity that causes pleasure, while the object plays the
role of the entity who is pleased.


We have just presented two contrasting views of semantics. In the
first case, we tried to get at the meaning of ex-sem1_ by translating
it into another language which we already understood. Moreover, we
assumed that we could tell whether the translation was successful, in
the sense of being able to say that ex-sem1_ and ex-sem2_ 'have the
same meaning'. In the second case, rather than relating ex-sem1_ to
a string of formal symbols, we related it to a situation in the
world, with entities and relations between those entities. In both
cases, we talked informally about how the meaning of the parts of the
ex-sem1_ could be combined to make up the meaning of the whole. This
idea about how meanings should be constructed is so fundamental that
we will give it a special name, that is, the `Principle of Compositionality`:dt:.
(See [Partee1995LSC]_ for this formulation.)

Principle of Compositionality:
   The meaning of a whole is a function of the meanings of the parts
   and of the way they are syntactically combined.

So far, so good. But what about computational semantics? Can a
computer understand the meaning of a sentence? And how could we tell
if it did?  This is similar to asking 'Can a computer think?' Alan
Turing [Turing1950CMI]_ famously proposed to answer this by examining
the ability of a computer to hold sensible conversations with a
human. Suppose you are having a chat session with a person and a
computer, but you are not told at the outset which is which. If you
cannot identify which of your partners is the computer after chatting
to each of them, then the computer has successfully imitated a
human. If a computer succeeds in passing itself off as human in this
'imitation game', then according to Turing, we should be prepared to
say that the computer `can`:em: think and can be said to be
intelligent. So Turing sidestepped the question of somehow examining
the internal states of a computer by instead using its `behaviour`:em:
as evidence of intelligence. By the same reasoning, we could argue
that in order to say that a computer understands English, it just
needs to behave as though it did.  What is important here is not so
much the specifics of Turing's imitation game, but rather the proposal
to judge a capacity for natural language understanding in terms of
observable behaviour on the part of the computer.

Querying a Database
-------------------

There a variety of tasks that a computer could perform which might be
considered as involving some amount of natural language
understanding. Right now, we will look at one in particular: we type in
a query in English, and the computer responds with an appropriate (and
if we are lucky, correct) answer. For example:

.. _ex-dbq0:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-dbq01:
   .. ex:: Which country is Athens in?
   .. _ex-dbq02:
   .. ex:: Greece.

Building software that allows this task to be carried out in a general
way is extremely hard, but solving it for a particular case is close
to trivial. We start off by assuming that we have data about cities
and countries in a structured form. To be concrete, we will use a
database table whose first few rows are shown in Table cities_.

.. Note:: The data illustrated in Table cities_ is drawn from the Chat-80 system
   described by [Warren1982EEA]_, which will be  discussed in more detail
   later in the chapter.  Population figures are given in thousands,
   but note that the data used in these examples dates back at least
   to the 1980s, and was already somewhat out of date at the point
   when [Warren1982EEA]_ was published.

.. table:: cities

    ============    ===============	===========
    City            Country		Population
    ============    ===============	===========
    athens	    greece		1368
    bangkok	    thailand		1178
    barcelona	    spain		1280
    berlin	    east_germany	3481
    birmingham	    united_kingdom	1112
    ============    ===============	===========

    ``city_table``: A table of cities, countries and populations

The obvious way to retrieve answers from this tabular data involves
writing queries in a database query language such as SQL. 

.. Note::
     SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language designed for
     retrieving and managing data in relational databases.
     If you want to find out more about SQL,
     `<http://www.w3schools.com/sql/>`_ is a convenient online
     reference.

For example, executing the query ex-dbq1_ will pull out the value ``'greece'``:
  
.. _ex-dbq1:
.. ex::
   SELECT Country FROM city_table WHERE City = 'athens'

This specifies a result set consisting of all values for the column
``Country`` in data rows where the value of the ``City`` column is
``'athens'``.

How can we get the same effect using English as our input to the query
system? The framework offered by the feature-based grammar formalism
developed in Chapter chap-featgram_ makes it easy to translate from
English to SQL. The grammar ``sql0.fcfg`` illustrates how to assemble
a meaning representation for a sentence in tandem with parsing the
sentence. Each phrase structure rule is supplemented with a recipe for
constructing a value for the feature ``sem``. As you will see, these
recipes are extremely simple; in each case, we use the string
concatenation operation ``+`` (see Chapter chap-featgram_ [NB give section]) to splice
the values for the daughter constituents to make a value for the
mother constituent.
  
    >>> nltk.data.show_cfg('grammars/sql0.fcfg')
    % start S
    S[sem=(?np + WHERE + ?vp)] -> NP[sem=?np] VP[sem=?vp]
    VP[sem=(?v + ?pp)] -> IV[sem=?v] PP[sem=?pp]
    VP[sem=(?v + ?ap)] -> IV[sem=?v] AP[sem=?ap]
    NP[sem=(?det + ?n)] -> Det[sem=?det] N[sem=?n]
    PP[sem=(?p + ?np)] -> P[sem=?p] NP[sem=?np]
    AP[sem=?pp] -> A[sem=?a] PP[sem=?pp]
    NP[sem='Country="greece"'] -> 'Greece'
    NP[sem='Country="china"'] -> 'China'
    Det[sem='SELECT'] -> 'Which' | 'What'
    N[sem='City FROM city_table'] -> 'cities'
    IV[sem=''] -> 'are'
    A -> 'located'
    P[sem=''] -> 'in'

This allows us to parse a query into SQL.
  
    >>> from nltk.parse import load_earley
    >>> from string import join
    >>> cp = load_earley('grammars/sql0.fcfg')
    >>> query = 'What cities are located in China'
    >>> trees = cp.nbest_parse(query.split())
    >>> answer = trees[0].node['sem']
    >>> q = join(answer)
    >>> print q
    SELECT City FROM city_table WHERE Country="china"

.. note:: |TRY|
   Run the parser with maximum tracing on, i.e.,
   ``cp = load_earley('grammars/sql0.fcfg', trace=3)``, and examine
   how the values of ``sem`` are built up as complete edges are added
   to the chart.

Finally, we execute the query over the database ``city.db`` and
retrieve some results.

    >>> from nltk.sem import chat80
    >>> rows = chat80.sql_query('samples/city.db', q)
    >>> for r in rows: print "%s" % r,
    canton chungking dairen harbin kowloon mukden peking shanghai sian tientsin

Let's review what we've just learned. We claimed earlier that one way
of getting a computer to understand English was making it perform
tasks that seem to require some processing of meaning. The specific
task that we've just examined involves the computer giving useful data
back in response to a natural language query, and we implemented this
by translating a small subset of English into SQL. So to the extent
that our software already understands SQL, in the sense of being
able to execute SQL queries against a database, it also undertands
queries such as `What cities are located in China`:lx:. 

The grammar ``sql0.fcfg``, together with the NLTK Earley parser, is
instrumental in carrying out the translation. How adequate is this
grammar? On the positive side, it follows the Principle of Compositionality
ins assigning some kind of meaning to the parts
of sentences. For example, `what cities`:lx: receives the meaning
``SELECT City from city_table``. The parts can then be combined to
make a translation for the whole sentence, so one can imagine that the
approach could be adopted for other queries of a similar
sort. However, there are also several less satisfactory aspects to
``sql0.fcfg``. First off, we
have hard-wired an embarrassing amount of detail about the database:
we need to know the name of the relevant table (e.g., ``city_table``)
and the names of the fields. But our database could have contained
exactly the same rows of data yet used a different table name and
different field names, in which case the SQL queries would not be executable. Equally,
we could have stored our data in a different format, such as XML, in
which case retrieving the same results would require us to translate
our English queries into an XML query language rather than SQL. These
considerations suggest that we should be translating English into
something that is more abstract and generic than something like SQL.

In order to sharpen the point, let's consider another English query
and its translation:

.. _ex-dbq2:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-dbq21:
   .. ex:: What	cities are in China and have populations above 1,000,000?
   .. _ex-dbq22:
   .. ex:: SELECT City FROM city_table WHERE Country = 'china' AND
           Population > 1000

.. note:: |TRY|
   Extend the grammar ``sql0.fcfg`` so that it will translate
   ex-dbq21_ into ex-dbq22_, and check the values returned by
   the query. 

   You will probably find it easiest to first extend the grammar to
   handle queries like `What cities have populations above
   1,000,000`:lx: before tackling conjunction. After you have had a go
   at this task, you can compare your solution to ``grammars/sql1.fcfg`` in
   the NLTK data distribution.

As you can see, the `and`:lx: conjunction in ex-dbq21_ gets translated
into an ``AND`` in the SQL counterpart, ex-dbq22_. The latter tells us
to select results from rows where two conditions are true
together: the value of the ``Country`` column is ``'china'`` and the
value of the ``Population`` column is greater than 1000. This
interpretation for `and`:lx: invokes an idea we mentioned earlier,
namely it talks about what is true in some particular
situation. Moreover, although we haven't exhausted the meaning of
`and`:lx: in English, we have given it a meaning which is independent
of any query language. In fact, we have given it the standard
interpretation from standard logic. In the following sections, we will
explore an approach in which sentences of natural language are
translated into logic instead of an executable query language. One
advantage is that logical formalisms are more abstract and therefore
more generic. If we wanted to, once we had our translation into logic,
we could then translate it further into a task-specific query
language. In fact, most serious attempts to query databases via
natural language have adopted this methodology; cf. [Androutsopoulos1995NLI]_.

Natural Language and Logic
--------------------------

In Section sec-log-semantics-introduction_, we already touched on two
fundamental notions from the logician's approach to semantics. The
first is that declarative sentences are `true or false in certain situations`:em:. 
The second is that definite noun phrases and proper nouns `refer to things
in the world`:em:. To return to our earlier example, we suggested that ex-sem1_
was true in a situation, where Stefan likes the camera in question,
here illustrated in in Figure fig-stefan-and-camera_.

.. _fig-stefan-and-camera:
.. figure:: ../images/stefan_and_camera_with_arrows.png
   :scale: 20

Once we have adopted the notion of truth in situation, we have a
powerful tool for reasoning.  In particular, we can start to consider
sets of sentences, and ask whether they could be true together in some
situation. For example, the sentences in ex-cons1_ can be both true,
while those in ex-cons2_ and  ex-cons3_ cannot be. In other words, the sentences in
ex-cons1_ are `consistent`:dt:, while those in ex-cons2_ and ex-cons3_ are
`inconsistent`:dt:.

.. _ex-cons1:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-cons11:
   .. ex:: Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia.
   .. _ex-cons12:
   .. ex:: Freedonia is a republic.

.. _ex-cons2:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-cons21:
   .. ex:: The capital of Freedonia has a population of 9,000.
   .. _ex-cons22:
   .. ex:: No city in Freedonia has a population of 9,000.

.. _ex-cons3:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-cons31:
   .. ex:: Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia.
   .. _ex-cons32:
   .. ex:: Freedonia is to the north of Sylvania.

We have chosen sentences about fictional countries (featured in the
Marx Brothers' 1933 movie *Duck Soup*) to emphasize that your ability
to reason about these examples does `not`:em: depend on what is true
or false in the actual world. If you know the meaning of `no`:lx:, and
that the capital of a country is a city in that country, then you
should be able to conclude that the two sentences in ex-cons2_ are
inconsistent, regardless of where Freedonia is or what the population
of its capital is. That is, there's no possible situation in which
both sentences could be true. Similarly, if you know that the relation
expressed by `to the north of`:lx: is asymmetric, then you should be
able to conclude that the two sentences in ex-cons3_ are inconsistent.

Broadly speaking, logic-based approaches to natural language semantics
focus on those aspects of natural language which contribute to our
judgments of consistency and inconsistency. The syntax of a logical
language is designed to make these features formally explicit. As a
result, determining properties like consistency can often be reduced
to symbolic manipulation, that is, to a task that can be carried out
by a computer.

As we will see shortly, a widely adopted approach to representing
natural language meaning involves translating expressions of
natural language into |fol| (|FOL|). From a computational point of
view, a strong argument in favor of |FOL| is that it strikes a
reasonable balance between expressiveness and logical tractability. On
the one hand, it is flexible enough to represent many aspects of the
logical structure of natural language. On the other hand, automated
theorem proving for |FOL| has been well studied, and although
inference in |FOL| is not decidable, in practice many reasoning
problems are efficiently solvable using modern theorem provers
(cf. [Blackburn2005RIN]_ for discussion).


A `model`:dt: for a set |Gamma| of sentences is a formal
representation of a situation in which all the sentences in |Gamma|
are true. Standardly, models are represented in set theory. The domain
*D* of discourse (all the entities we currently care about) is a set of
individuals, while properties and relations are usually treated as
sets built up from *D*. Let's look at a concrete example. Our domain
*D* will consist of three
children, Stefan, Klaus and Evi, represented respectively as ``s``,
``k`` and ``e``. We write this as *D* = ``{s, k, e}``. The property `boy`:math: is the
set consisting of Stefan and Klaus, the property `girl`:math: is the
set consisting of Evi, and the property `is running`:math: is the
set consisting of Stefan and Evi. fig-model-kids_ is a graphical
rendering of the model.

.. _fig-model-kids:

   :scale: 10



--------------------
Propositional  Logic
--------------------

As mentioned earlier, a logical language is designed to capture
certain aspects of natural language which contribute to determining
whether a set of sentences is consistent. This in turn requires that a logical
representation of a sentence `S`:math: helps make the
`truth-conditions`:dt: of a `S`:math: explicit.

.. _ex-proplog1:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-proplog11:
   .. ex::
      [Shanghai is to the north of Guangzhou] and 
      [the urban population of Shanghai is 15.5 million].
      
   .. _ex-proplog12:
   .. ex::
      [Klaus chased Evi] and [Evi ran away].

If we temporarily ignore the internal details of the sentences
enclosed by square brackets, then both of them have the same
structure:

.. _ex-proplog2:
.. ex:: `P`:math: `and`:lx: `Q`:math:

We will sometimes say that ex-proplog2_ is the `logical form`:dt: (or
|LF| for short) of sentences like ex-proplog1_. We can state the
truth-conditions for ex-proplog2_ along the following lines:

.. _ex-proplog3:
.. ex:: A sentence of the form '`P`:math: `and`:lx: `Q`:math:' is true
        in a situation `s`:math: if `P`:math: is true in `s`:math: and
	`Q`:math: is true in `s`:math:.

As we observed above, the inconsistency of ex-cons3_ arises from the
asymmetry of the relation `x is to the north of y`:lx: (where
`x`:math: and `y`:math: are place-holders for noun
phrases). Informally, we can say the following:

.. _ex-proplog4:
.. ex:: if `x`:math: is to the north of `y`:math: then `y`:math: is not to the north of
        `x`:math:.

In propositional logic, negation expressions such as `not`:lx: are
treated as sentence operators. That is, the logical form of
ex-proplog51_ is something like ex-proplog52_.

.. _ex-proplog5:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-proplog51:
   .. ex::
      Sylvania is not to the north of Freedonia.
      
   .. _ex-proplog52:
   .. ex::
      It is not the case that [Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia].

A more succinct version of ex-proplog52_ is ex-proplog6_, where |neg|
symbolizes `it is not the case that`:lx:.

.. _ex-proplog6:
.. ex:: |neg|\ `P`:math:

.. _ex-proplog7:
.. ex:: A sentence of the form '|neg|\ `P`:math:' is true
        in a situation `s`:math: if `P`:math: is not true in `s`:math:.
 
Informally, given the schematic rule in
ex-proplog4_, then from ex-proplog81_ we can conclude ex-proplog82_:

.. _ex-proplog8:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-proplog81:
   .. ex::
      [Freedonia is to the north of Sylvania].
      
   .. _ex-proplog82:
   .. ex::
      |neg| [Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia].

So the two sentences in ex-cons3_ can be augmented to the following
set:

.. _ex-proplog9:
.. ex::
   [Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia]

   [Freedonia is to the north of Sylvania]

   |neg| [Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia]

Thus, the set in ex-proplog9_ contains a pair of sentences whose |LF|\
s are `P`:math: and |neg|\ `P`:math:. But a fundamental assumption of
classical logic is that a sentence cannot be both true and false in a
situation. Any set of sentences which contains both `P`:math: and
|neg|\ `P`:math: is inconsistent. In this way, we can see how reducing
sentences to their logical forms allows us to determine inconsistency.

As we have already indicated, `Propositional logic`:dt: is a formal
system for systematically representing just those parts of linguistic
structure which correspond to certain sentential conjunctions such as
`and`:lx:, `or`:lx: and `if..., then...`:lx:. In the formalization of
propositional logic, the counterparts of such conjunctions are
sometimes called `boolean operators`:dt:.  The basic expressions of
propositional logic are `propositional symbols`:dt:, which we shall
continue to write as `P`:math:, `Q`:math:, `R`:math:, etc.  There are
varying conventions for representing boolean operators. Here's one
choice: a unary operator |neg| (`not`:lx:), and four binary operators
|wedge| (`and`:lx:), |vee| (`or`:lx:), |rarr| (`if..., then...`:lx:)
and |iff| (`if and only if`:lx:).  Then the set of `formulas`:dt: of
propositional logic can be defined as follows:

   1. Every propositional symbol is a formula.

   2. If |phi| is a formula, then so is |neg| |phi|.

   3. If |phi| and |psi| are formulas, then so are
      (|phi| |wedge| |psi|),
      (|phi| |vee| |psi|),
      (|phi| |rarr| |psi|) 
      (|phi| |iff| |psi|).

The module ``nltk.sem.logic`` allows us to parse formulas of
propositional logic. However, it only recognizes ascii versions of the boolean operators: 

    >>> from nltk.sem import logic
    >>> logic.boolean_ops()
    negation       	-
    conjunction    	&
    disjunction    	|
    implication    	->
    equivalence    	<-> 

Within ``logic``, ``LogicParser()`` parses logical expressions into
various subclasses of ``Expression``:

    >>> lp = logic.LogicParser()
    >>> lp.parse('-(P & Q)')
    <NegatedExpression -(P & Q)>
    >>> lp.parse('P & Q')
    <AndExpression (P & Q)>
    >>> lp.parse('P | (R -> Q)')
    <OrExpression (P | (R -> Q))>
    >>> lp.parse('P <-> -- P')
    <IffExpression (P <-> --P)>


As mentioned above, we interpret sentences of a logical language
relative to a model, which is a very simplified version of the
world. A model for propositional logic needs to assign the values
``True`` or ``False`` to every possible formula. We do this
inductively: first, every propositional symbol is assigned a value,
and then we compute the value of complex formulas by consulting the
meanings of the Boolean connectives and applying them to the values of
the formula's components. A ``Valuation`` is a mapping from basic
expressions of the logic to their values. Here's an example:

    >>> val = nltk.sem.Valuation([('P', True), ('Q', True), ('R', False)])

We initialize a ``Valuation`` with a list of pairs, each of which
consists of a semantic symbol and a semantic value. The resulting
object is essentially just a dictionary that maps logical expressions
(treated as strings) to appropriate values.

    >>> val['P']
    True

As we will see later, our models need to be somewhat more complicated
in order to handle the more complex logical forms discussed in the
next section; for the time being, just ignore the ``dom`` and
``g`` parameters in the following declarations.

    >>> dom = set([])
    >>> g = nltk.sem.Assignment(dom)

Now let's initialize a model ``m`` that uses ``val``:

    >>> m = nltk.sem.Model(dom, val)
    
Every instance of ``Model`` defines appropriate truth functions for the
boolean connectives; these can be invoked to show how input values are
mapped to output values. Here are the truth conditions for ``&`` and ``->``
(encoded via the functions ``AND()`` and ``IMPLIES()`` respectively):

    >>> ops = [m.AND, m.IMPLIES]
    >>> for o in ops:
    ...     print "==========="
    ...     print o.func_name
    ...     for first in [True, False]:
    ...         for second in [True, False]:
    ...             print "%-5s %-5s => %s" % (first, second, o(first, second))
    ===========
    AND
    True  True  => True
    True  False => False
    False True  => False
    False False => False
    ===========
    IMPLIES
    True  True  => True
    True  False => False
    False True  => True
    False False => True

If you reflect on the truth conditions of ``->``, you will see that it
departs in many cases from our usual intuitions about the conditional
in English. A formula of the form ``P -> Q`` is only false when ``P``
is true and ``Q`` is false. If ``P`` is false (say ``P`` corresponds
to `The moon is made of green cheese`:lx:) and ``Q`` is true (say
``Q`corresponds to `Two plus two equals four`:lx:) then ``P -> Q``
will come out true.

Every model comes with an ``evaluate()`` method, which will determine
the semantic value of logical expression, such as formulas of
propositional logic; of course, these values depend on the initial
truth values we assigned to propositional symbols such as ``'P'``,
``'Q'`` and ``'R'``.

    >>> print m.evaluate('(P & Q)', g)
    True
    >>> print m.evaluate('-(P & Q)', g)
    False
    >>> print m.evaluate('(P & R)', g)
    False
    >>> print m.evaluate('(P | R)', g)
    True

.. note:: |TRY| 
   Experiment with evaluating different formulas of
   propositional logic. Does the model give the values that you
   expected?

Up until now, we have treated the internal structure of sentences as
being opaque to logical analysis. However, if we are to formalize
arguments like ex-proplog4_ in a way that allows us to compute with
them, we have to be able look inside clauses. This is what we turn to
in the next section.

-----------------
First-Order Logic
-----------------

Syntax
------

In |fol| (|FOL|), propositions are analyzed into predicates and
arguments, which takes us a step closer to the structure of natural
languages. The standard construction rules for |FOL| recognize
`terms`:dt: such as individual variables and individual constants, and
`predicates`:dt: which take differing numbers of arguments. For
example, `Adam walks`:lx: might be formalized as `walk(adam)`:mathit:
and `Adam sees Betty`:lx: as `see(adam, betty)`:mathit:. We will call
`walk`:mathit: a `unary predicate`:dt:, and `see`:mathit: a `binary
predicate`:dt:. The symbols used as predicates do not have intrinsic
meaning, although it is hard to remember this. Returning to one of our
earlier examples, there is no `logical`:em: difference between ex-predlog11_
and  ex-predlog12_.

.. _ex-predlog1:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-predlog11:
   .. ex::
      please(agfa_kx7750, stefan)
      
   .. _ex-predlog12:
   .. ex::
       gef\ |aumlaut|\ llen(agfa_kx7750, stefan)

By itself, |FOL| has nothing substantive to say about lexical
semantics |mdash| the meaning of individual words |mdash| although
some theories of lexical semantics can be encoded in |FOL|. Whether an
atomic predication like `see(adam, betty)`:mathit: is true or false in
a situation is not a matter of logic, but depends on the particular
valuation that we have chosen for the constants `see`:mathit:,
`adam`:mathit: and `betty`:mathit:. For this reason, such expressions
are called `non-logical constants`:dt:. By contrast, `logical
constants`:dt: (such as the boolean operators) always receive the same
interpretation in every model for |FOL|.

We should mention here that one binary predicate which has special
status, and that is equality, as in formulas such as `adam =
aj`:mathit:. Equality is regarded as a logical constant, since for
individual terms `t1`:math: and `t2`:math:, the formula `t1 = t2`:math: is
true if and only if `t1`:math: and `t2`:math: refer to one and the
same entity.

It is often helpful to inspect the syntactic structure of expressions
of |FOL|, and the usual way of doing this is to assign `types`:dt: to
expressions. Following the tradition of Montague grammar [refs], we
will use two `basic types`:dt:\: `e`:math: is the type of entities,
while  `t`:math: is the type of formulas, i.e., expressions which have
truth values.

.. TO-DO: expand stuff on types

    >>> parsed = lp.parse('see(a, b)')
    >>> parsed.argument
    <IndividualVariableExpression b>   
    >>> parsed.function
    <ApplicationExpression see(a)>
    >>> parsed.function.function
    <VariableExpression see>

In |FOL|, arguments of predicates can also be individual variables
such as `x`:math:, `y`:math: and `z`:math:. Individual variables are similar to
personal pronouns like `he`:lx:, `she`:lx: and `it`:lx:, in that we
need to know about the context of use in order to figure out their
denotation. 

One way of interpreting the pronoun in ex-predlog2_ is by
pointing to a relevant individual in the local context.

.. _ex-predlog2:
.. ex:: He disappeared.

Another way is to supply a textual antecedent for the pronoun
`he`:lx:, for example by uttering ex-predlog31_ prior to
ex-predlog2_. Here, we say that `she`:lx: is `coreferential`:dt: with
the noun phrase `Cyril`:lx:. As a result, ex-predlog2_ is semantically
equivalent to ex-predlog32_.

.. _ex-predlog3:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-predlog31:
   .. ex:: Cyril is Angus's dog.

   .. _ex-predlog32:
   .. ex:: Cyril disappeared.

Consider by contrast the occurrence of `she`:lx: in ex-predlog41_. In
this case, it is `bound`:dt: by the indefinite `NP`:gc: 
`a poodle`:lx:, 
and this is a different relationship than
coreference. If we replace the pronoun `she`:lx: by `a poodle`:lx:,
the result ex-predlog42_ is `not`:em: semantically equivalent to ex-predlog41_.

.. _ex-predlog4:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-predlog41:
   .. ex:: Angus had a dog but he disappeared.

   .. _ex-predlog42:
   .. ex:: Angus had a dog but a dog disappeared.

Corresponding to ex-predlog51_, we can construct an `open formula`:dt:
ex-predlog52_ with two occurrences of the variable `x`:math:. (We
ignore tense to simplify exposition.)

.. _ex-predlog5:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-predlog51:
   .. ex:: He is a dog and he disappeared.

   .. _ex-predlog52:
   .. ex:: `dog(x)`:mathit:  |wedge| `disappear(x)`:mathit: 

By placing an `existential quantifier`:dt :|exists|\ `x`:math: ('for
some `x`:math:') in front of ex-predlog52_, we can `bind`:dt: these
variables, as in ex-predlog61_, which means ex-predlog62_ or, more
idiomatically, ex-predlog63_.

.. _ex-predlog6:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-predlog61:
   .. ex:: |exists|\ `x.dog(x)`:mathit:  |wedge| `disappear(x)`:mathit: 

   .. _ex-predlog62:
   .. ex:: At least one entity is a dog and disappeared.

   .. _ex-predlog63:
   .. ex:: A dog disappeared.

The |NLTK| rendering of ex-predlog61_ is ex-exists_.

.. _ex-exists:
.. ex:: ``exists x. (dog(x) & disappear(x))``

If all variable occurrences in a formula are bound, the formula is
said to be `closed`:dt:. Any variables which are not bound in a formula
are `free`:dt: in that formula. 
As mentioned before, the ``parse()`` method of ``nltk.sem.logic``\ 's
``LogicParser`` returns objects of class ``Expression``. As such, each
expression ``e`` comes with a method ``free()`` which returns the set
of variables that are free in ``e``.

    >>> print lp.parse('dog(cyril)').free()
    set([])
    >>> print lp.parse('dog(x)').free()
    set([Variable('x')])
    >>> print lp.parse('own(angus, cyril)').free()
    set([])
    >>> print lp.parse('exists x. dog(x)').free()
    set([])
    >>> print lp.parse(r'exists x. own(y, x)').free()
    set([Variable('y')])


In addition to the existential quantifier, |FOL| offers us the
`universal quantifier`:dt: |forall|\ `x`:math: ('for all
`x`:math:'), illustrated in ex-predlog7_.

.. _ex-predlog7:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-predlog71:
   .. ex:: |forall|\ `x.dog(x)`:mathit: |rarr| `disappear(x)`:mathit: 

   .. _ex-predlog72:
   .. ex:: Everything has the property that if it is a dog, it disappear.

   .. _ex-predlog73:
   .. ex:: Every dog disappeared.

The |NLTK| rendering of ex-predlog71_ is ex-forall_.

.. _ex-forall:
.. ex:: ``all x. (dog(x) -> disappear(x))``

One important property of ex-predlog71_ often trips people up. The
logical rendering in effect says that `if`:em: something is a dog, then
it runs away, but makes no commitment to the existence of dogs. So
in a situation where there are no dog, ex-predlog71_ will still
come out true. (Remember that ``'(p implies q)'`` is true when ``'p'``
is false.) Now you might argue that ex-predlog71_ does presuppose the
existence of dogs, and that the logic formalization is wrong.  But it
is possible to find other examples which lack such a presupposition.
For instance, we might explain that the value of the Python expression
``re.sub('ate', '8', astring)`` is the result of replacing all
occurrences of ``'ate'`` in ``astring`` by ``'8'``, even though there
may in fact be no such occurrences.

In Section sec-computing-with-language-simple-statistics_, we pointed out that
mathematical set notation was a helpful method of specifying
properties `P`:math: of words that we wanted to select from a
document. We illustrated this with ex-set-comprehension-math2_, which we
glossed as "the set of all `w`:math: such that `w`:math: is an element
of `V`:math: (the vocabulary) and `w`:math: has property `P`:math:".

.. _ex-set-comprehension-math2:
.. ex:: {`w`:math: | `w`:math: |element| `V`:math: & `P(w)`:math:\ }

It turns out to be extremely useful to add something to |FOL| that
will achieve the same effect. We do this with the `lambda
operator`:dt: |lambda|\ `x`:math:. The |lambda| counterpart to
ex-set-comprehension-math2_ is ex-lambda1_. (Since we are not trying
to do set-theory here, we just treat `V`:math: as a unary predicate.)

.. _ex-lambda1:
.. ex:: |lambda|\ `w`:math:. (`V(w)`:math: |wedge| `P(w)`:math:)

.. Note:: |lambda| expression were originally designed to represent
    computable functions and to provide a foundation for mathematics
    and logic. The theory in which |lambda| expressions are studied is
    known as the |lambda|-calculus.


|lambda| is a binding operator, just as the |FOL| quantifiers are. If
we have an open formula such as ex-walk-chewgum1_, then we can bind
the variable `x`:math: with the |lambda| operator, as shown in
ex-walk-chewgum2_.

.. _ex-walk-chewgum1:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-walk-chewgum11:
   .. ex:: (`walk(x)`:mathit: |wedge| `chew_gum(x)`:mathit:) 

   .. _ex-walk-chewgum12:
   .. ex:: |lambda|\ `x. (walk(x)`:mathit: |wedge| `chew_gum(x)`:mathit:)

ex-walk-chewgum12_ is represented in |NLTK| as 

.. _ex-lambda:
.. ex:: ``\x. (walk(x) & chew_gum(x))``

Actually, this is a slight oversimplification, since ``\`` also
happens to be a special character in Python. We could escape it
(with another ``\``), but in practice we will use raw strings, as
illustrated here:

    >>> e = lp.parse(r'\x. (walk(x) & chew_gum(x))')
    >>> e
    <LambdaExpression \x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(x))>
    >>> e.free()
    set([])
    >>> print lp.parse(r'\x. (walk(x) & chew_gum(y))')
    \x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(y))

We have a special name for the result of binding the variables in an
expression: `lambda abstraction`:dt:. When one initially encounters
|lambda|-abstracts, it can be hard to get an intuitive sense of their
meaning. A couple of English glosses for ex-walk-chewgum12_ are: "be
an `x`:math: such that `x`:math: walks and `x`:math: chews gum" or
"have the property of walking and chewing gum". Within the tradition
of formal semantics of natural language, it has often been suggested
that |lambda|-abstracts are good representations for verb phrases (or
subjectless clauses), particularly when these occur as arguments in
their own right. This is illustrated in ex-walk-chewgum21_ and its
translation ex-walk-chewgum22_.

.. _ex-walk-chewgum2:
.. ex::
   .. _ex-walk-chewgum21:
   .. ex:: To walk and chew-gum is hard

   .. _ex-walk-chewgum22:
   .. ex:: `hard`:mathit:\ (|lambda|\ `x. (walk(x)`:mathit: |wedge| `chew_gum(x)`:mathit:) 

So the general picture is this: given an an open formula |phi| with
free variable `x`:math:, abstracting over `x`:math: yields a property
expression |lambda|\ `x.`:math:\ |phi| |mdash| the property of being
an `x`:math: such that |phi|. ex-walk-chewgum22_ illustrates a case
where we say something about a property, namely that it is hard. But
what we usually do with properties is attribute them to
individuals. And in fact if |phi| is an open formula, then the
abstract |lambda|\ `x.`:math:\ |phi| can be used as a unary
predicate. In ex-walk-chewgum3_, ex-walk-chewgum12_ is predicated of
the term `gerald`:mathit:.

.. _ex-walk-chewgum3:
.. ex:: |lambda|\ `x. (walk(x)`:mathit: |wedge| `chew_gum(x)`:mathit:) (`gerald`:mathit:)

Given the intended interpretation of ex-walk-chewgum3_, we would like
it to be semantically equivalent to ex-walk-chewgum4_.

.. _ex-walk-chewgum4:
.. ex:: `(walk(gerald)`:mathit: |wedge| `chew_gum(gerald)`:mathit:) 

In fact, the equivalence of ex-walk-chewgum3_ and  ex-walk-chewgum4_
follows from one of the axioms of the |lambda| calculus, namely
`beta-conversion`:dt:. 

The rule of |beta|-conversion
    |lambda|\ `x.`:math: |alpha|\ (`t`:math:) = |alpha|\ [`t/x`:math:]

This rule can be read as follows: if we apply a |lambda|\ -abstract
|lambda|\ `x.`:math:\ |alpha| to a term `t`:math: , the result is the same
as removing the |lambda|\ `x.`:math: operator and replacing all free
occurrences of `x`:math: in |alpha| by `t`:math:. (This second operation
is what is meant by the notation |alpha|\ [`t/x`:math:].) So, for
example, if we apply the rule of |beta|-conversion to
ex-walk-chewgum3_, we remove the initial '|lambda|\ `x.`:math:' from 
|lambda|\ `x.(walk(x)`:mathit: |wedge| `chew_gum(x)`:mathit:) and
then replace all free occurrences of `x`:math: in `((walk(x)`:mathit:
|wedge| `chew_gum(x)`:mathit:) by the term
`gerald`:mathit:. |beta|-conversion is effected in the ``logic``
module with the ``simplify()`` method.

    >>> print lp.parse(r'\x. (walk(x) & chew_gum(x))(gerald)')
    \x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(x))(gerald)
    >>> print lp.parse(r'\x. (walk(x) & chew_gum(x))(gerald)').simplify()
    (walk(gerald) & chew_gum(gerald))    

Although we have so far only considered cases where the body of the
|lambda| abstract is an open formula, i.e., of type t, this is not a
necessary restriction; the body can be any well-formed
expression. Here's an example with two |lambda|\ s.

.. _ex-double-lambda:
.. ex::  |lambda|\ `x.`:math: |lambda|\ `y. (poodle(x)`:mathit: |wedge| `own(y, x)`:mathit:)

Just as ex-walk-chewgum12_ plays the role of a unary predicate,
ex-double-lambda_ works like a binary predicate: it can be applied to
two arguments. The ``LogicParser`` allows nested |lambda|\ s to be
written in abbreviated form, as illustrated in the second case below.

    >>> print lp.parse(r'\x. \y. (dog(x) & own(y, x))(cyril)').simplify()
    \y.(dog(cyril) & own(y,cyril))
    >>> print lp.parse(r'\x y. (dog(x) & own(y, x))(cyril, angus)').simplify()
    (dog(cyril) & own(angus,cyril))


We'll take this opportunity to restate our earlier syntactic rules for
propositional logic and add the formation rules for quantifiers. In
addition, we make explicit the types of the expressions involved.

   1. If `P`:math: is a predicate of type <e\ :sup:`n`, t>, and |tau|\ :sub:`1`,
      ... |tau|\ :sub:`n` are terms of type e, then `P`:math:\ (|tau|\ :sub:`1`,
      ... |tau|\ :sub:`n`) is of type t.

   2. If |phi| is of type t, then so is |neg|\ |phi|.

   3.  If |phi| and |psi| are of type t, then so are
       (|phi| |wedge| |psi|),
       (|phi| |vee| |psi|),
       (|phi| |rarr| |psi|) and
       (|phi| |iff| |psi|).

   4. If |phi| is of type t, and `x`:math: is a variable of type e, then
      |exists|\ `x.`:math:\ |phi| and  |forall|\ `x.`:math:\ |phi| are of
      type t.

   5. If |alpha| is of type |tau|, and `x`:math: is a variable of type e, then
      |lambda|\ `x.`:math:\ |alpha| is of type <e, |tau|>.

Model-theory
------------

We have looked at the syntax of |FOL|, and in Section
sec-evaluating-english-sentences_ we will examine the task of
translating English into |FOL|. Yet as we argued in Section
sec-log-semantics-introduction_, this only gets us further forward if
we can give a meaning to sentences of |FOL|. In other words, we need
to give a `truth-conditional semantics`:em: to |FOL|.
From the point of view of computational semantics, there are obvious
limits in how far one can push this approach. Although we want to talk
about sentences being true or false in situations, we only have the
means of representing situations in the computer in a symbolic
manner. Despite this limitation, it is still possible to gain a
clearer picture of truth-conditional semantics by encoding models in
|NLTK|. 

Given a |fol| language `L`:math:, a model `M`:math: for `L`:math: is a
pair |langle|\ `D`:math:, `Val`:math:\ |rangle|, where `D`:math: is an
nonempty set called the `domain`:dt: of the model, and `Val`:math: is
a function called the `valuation function`:dt: which assigns values
from `D`:math: to expressions of `L`:math: as follows:

    1. For every individual constant `c`:math: in `L`:math:,
       `Val(c)`:math: is an element of  `D`:math:.

    2. For every predicate symbol `P`:math: of arity `n`:math: |geq| 0,
       `Val(P)`:math: is a function from  `D`:math:\ :sup:`n` to
       {`True`:mathit:, `False`:mathit:}. (If the rank of  `P`:math:
       is 0, then `Val(P)`:math: is simply a truth value, the
       `P`:math: is regarded as a propositional symbol.)

According to (2), if `P`:math: is of arity `n`:math:, then `Val(P)`:math:
will be a function `f`:math: from pairs of elements of  `D`:math: to
{`True`:mathit:, `False`:mathit:}. In the models we shall build in
|NLTK|, we'll adopt a more convenient alternative, in which
`Val(P)`:math: is a set `S`:math: of pairs, defined as follows:

.. ex::  `S`:math: = {`s`:math: | `f(s)`:math: = `True`:mathit:\ }

Such an `f`:math: is called the `characteristic function`:dt: of `S`:math:.

Relations are represented semantically in |NLTK| in the standard
set-theoretic way: as sets of tuples. For example, let's suppose we
have a domain of discourse consisting of the individuals Bertie, Olive and Cyril,
where Bertie is a boy, Olive is a girl and Cyril is a dog. For mnemonic
reasons, we use ``b``, ``o`` and ``c`` as the corresponding labels
in the model. We can declare the domain as follows:

    >>> dom = set(['b', 'o', 'c'])

We will use the utility function ``parse_valuation()`` to convert a
list of strings of the form `symbol`:mathit: ``=>`` `value`:mathit:
into a ``Valuation`` object.

    >>> from nltk.sem import parse_valuation
    >>> v = """
    ... bertie => b
    ... olive => o
    ... cyril => c
    ... boy => {b}
    ... girl => {o}
    ... dog => {c}
    ... walk => {o, c}
    ... see => {(b, o), (c, b), (o, c)}
    ... """
    >>> val = parse_valuation(v)
    >>> print val
    {'bertie': 'b',
     'boy': set([('b',)]),
     'cyril': 'c',
     'dog': set([('c',)]),
     'girl': set([('o',)]),
     'olive': 'o',
     'see': set([('o', 'c'), ('c', 'b'), ('b', 'o')]),
     'walk': set([('c',), ('o',)])}


So according to this valuation, the value of ``see`` is a set of
tuples such that Bertie sees Olive, Cyril sees Bertie, and
Olive sees Cyril.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Draw a picture of the domain of ``m`` and the sets corresponding to
   each of the unary predicates, by analogy with the diagram shown in
   fig-model-kids_. 

You may have noticed that our unary predicates (i.e, ``boy``, ``girl``,
``dog``) also come out as sets of singleton tuples, rather
than just sets of individuals. This is a convenience which allows us
to have a uniform treatment of relations of any arity. A predication
of the form `P`:math:\ (|tau|\ :sub:`1`,  ... |tau|\ :sub:`n`), where
`P`:math: is of arity `n`:math:, comes out true just in case the
tuple of values corresponding to (|tau|\ :sub:`1`,  ... |tau|\
:sub:`n`) belongs to the set of tuples in the value of  `P`:math:.

    >>> ('c', 'b') in val['see']
    True
    >>> ('b',) in val['boy']
    True

Individual Variables and Assignments
------------------------------------

In our models, the counterpart of a context of use is a variable
`Assignment`:dt:. This is a mapping from individual variables to
entities in the domain.  Assignments are created using the
``Assignment`` constructor, which also takes the model's domain of
discourse as a parameter. We are not required to actually enter any
bindings, but if we do, they are in a (`variable`:mathit:,
`value`:mathit:) format similar to what we saw earlier for valuations.

    >>> g = nltk.sem.Assignment(dom, [('x', 'o'), ('y', 'c')])
    >>> g
    {'y': 'c', 'x': 'o'}

In addition, there is a ``print()`` format for assignments which
uses a notation closer to that often found in logic textbooks:

    >>> print g
    g[c/y][o/x]

Let's now look at how we can evaluate an atomic formula of
|FOL|. First, we create a model, then we use the ``evaluate()`` method
to compute the truth value.

    >>> m = nltk.sem.Model(dom, val)
    >>> m.evaluate('see(olive, y)', g)
    True

What's happening here? Essentially, we are evaluating the formula
``see('o', 'c')`` just as in our earlier example.
However, when the interpretation function encounters the variable ``'y'``,
rather than checking for a value in ``val``, it asks the variable
assignment ``g`` to come up with a value:
    
    >>> g['y']
    'c'

Since we already know that ``'o'`` and ``'c'`` stand in the `see`:mathit:
relation, the value ``True`` is what we expected. In this case, we can
say that assignment ``g`` `satisfies`:dt: the formula ``'see(olive, y)'``.
By contrast, the following formula evaluates to ``False`` relative to
``g`` |mdash| check that you see why this is.
    
    >>> m.evaluate('see(y, x)', g)
    False

In our approach (though not in standard |fol|), variable assignments
are `partial`:em:. For example, ``g`` says nothing about any variables
apart from ``'x'`` and ``'y'``. The method ``purge()`` clears all
bindings from an assignment.

    >>> g.purge()
    >>> g
    {}

If we now try to evaluate a formula such as ``'see(olive, y)'`` relative to
``g``, it is like trying to interpret a sentence containing a `him`:lx: when
we don't know what `him`:lx: refers to. In this case, the evaluation function
fails to deliver a truth value.

    >>> m.evaluate('see(olive, y)', g)
    'Undefined'


Quantification and Scope
------------------------

One of the crucial insights of modern
logic is that the notion of variable satisfaction can be used to
provide an interpretation to quantified formulas. Let's 
use exists1_ as an example.

.. _exists1:
   .. ex:: ``some x.(girl(x) & walk(x))``

When is it true? Let's think about all the individuals in our domain,
i.e., in ``dom``. We want to check whether any of these individuals
have the property of being a girl and walking. In other words, we want
to know if there is some ``u`` in ``dom`` such that ``g[u/x]``
satisfies the open formula exists2_.

.. _exists2:
.. ex:: ``girl(x) & walk(x)``

Consider the following:

    >>> m.evaluate('exists x.(girl(x) & walk(x))', g)
    True

``evaluate()`` returns ``True`` here because there is some ``u`` in
``dom`` such that exists2_ is satisfied by an assigment which binds
``'x'`` to ``u``. In fact, ``'o'`` is such a ``u``:

    >>> m.evaluate('girl(x) & walk(x)', g.add('x', 'o'))
    True

One useful tool offered by NLTK is the ``satisfiers()`` method. This
returns a set of all the individuals that satisfy an open formula. The
method parameters are a parsed formula, a variable, and an
assignment. Here are a few examples:

    >>> fmla1 = lp.parse('girl(x) | boy(x)')
    >>> m.satisfiers(fmla1, 'x', g)
    set(['b', 'o'])
    >>> fmla2 = lp.parse('girl(x) -> walk(x)')
    >>> m.satisfiers(fmla2, 'x', g)
    set(['c', 'b', 'o'])
    >>> fmla3 = lp.parse('walk(x) -> girl(x)')
    >>> m.satisfiers(fmla3, 'x', g)
    set(['b', 'o'])

It's useful to think about why ``fmla2`` and ``fmla3`` receive the
values they do. The truth conditions for ``->`` mean that 
``fmla2`` is equivalent to fmla2or_:

.. _fmla2or:
.. ex:: ``-girl(x) | walk(x)``

That is, fmla2or_ is satisfied by something which either isn't a girl
or walks. Since neither ``b`` (Bertie) nor ``c`` (Cyril)
are girls, according to model ``m``, they both satisfy 
the whole formula. And of course ``'o'`` satisfies the formula because ``'o'``
satisfies both disjuncts. Now, since every member of the domain of
discourse satisfies ``fmla2``, the corresponding universally
quantified formula is also true.

    >>> m.evaluate('all x.(girl(x) -> walk(x))', g)
    True

In other words, a universally quantified formula |forall|\
`x.`:mathit:\ |phi| is true with respect to ``g`` just in case for
every ``u``, |phi| is true with respect to ``g[u/x]``. 

.. note:: |TRY|
   Try to figure out, first with pencil and paper, and then using
   ``m.evaluate()``, what the truth values are for ``'all x.(girl(x) &
   walk(x))'`` and ``'exists x.(boy(x) -> walk(x))'``. Make sure you
   understand why they receive these values.
 
   


Quantifier Scope Ambiguity
--------------------------

What happens when we want to give a formal representation of a
sentence with *two* quantifiers, such as the following?

.. _scope1:
.. ex:: Everybody admires someone.

There are (at least) two ways of expressing scope1_ in |FOL|:

.. _scope2:
.. ex::

   .. _scope2a:
   .. ex:: |forall|\ `x.(person(x)`:mathit: |rarr| |exists|\
           `y.(person(y)`:mathit: |wedge| `admire(x,y)))`:mathit:

   .. _scope2b:
   .. ex:: |exists|\ `y.(person(y)`:mathit: |wedge| |forall|\
           `x.(person(x)`:mathit: |rarr|  `admire(x,y)))`:mathit:

Can we use both of these? Then answer is Yes, but they have different
meanings. scope2b_ is logically stronger than scope2a_: it claims that
there is a unique person, say Bruce, who is admired by everyone.
scope2a_, on the other hand, just requires that for every person
`u`:mathit:, we can find some person `u'`:mathit: whom `u`:mathit:
admires; but this could be a different person  `u'`:mathit: in each case. We
distinguish between scope2a_ and scope2b_ in terms of the `scope`:dt:
of the quantifiers. In the first, |forall| has wider scope than
|exists|, while in scope2b_, the scope ordering is reversed. So now we
have two ways of representing the meaning of scope1_, and they are
both quite legitimate. In other words, we are claiming that scope1_ is
*ambiguous* with respect to quantifier scope, and the formulas in
scope2_ give us a formal means of making the two readings
explicit. However, we are not just interested in associating two
distinct representations with scope1_. We also want to show in detail
how the two representations lead to different conditions for truth in
a formal model.

In order to examine the ambiguity more closely, let's fix our
valuation as follows:


    >>> from nltk.sem import parse_valuation
    >>> v2 = """
    ... bruce => b
    ... cyril => c
    ... elspeth => e
    ... julia => j
    ... matthew => m
    ... person => {b, e, j, m}
    ... admire => {(j, b), (b, b), (m, e), (e, m), (c, a)}
    ... """
    >>> val2 = parse_valuation(v2)

We can use the graph in admiregraph_ to visualize the
`admire`:mathit: relation.

.. _admiregraph:
.. ex::
   .. image:: ../images/models_admire.png
      :scale: 15

In admiregraph_, an arrow between two individuals `x`:math: and
`y`:math: indicates that `x`:math: admires
`y`:math:. So ``j`` and ``b`` both admire ``b`` (Bruce is very vain), while ``e`` admires
``m`` and ``m`` admires ``e``. In this model, formula scope2a_ above
is true but scope2b_ is false. One way of exploring these results is by
using the ``satisfiers()`` method of ``Model`` objects.

    >>> dom2 = val2.domain
    >>> m2 = nltk.sem.Model(dom2, val2)
    >>> g = nltk.sem.Assignment(dom2)
    >>> fmla4 = lp.parse('(person(x) -> exists y.(person(y) & admire(x, y)))')
    >>> m2.satisfiers(fmla4, 'x', g)
    set(['m', 'c', 'b', 'e', 'j'])

This shows that ``fmla4`` holds of every individual in the domain.
By contrast, consider the formula ``fmla5`` below; this has no
satisfiers for the variable ``y``.

    >>> fmla5 = lp.parse('(person(y) & all x.(person(x) -> admire(x, y)))')
    >>> m2.satisfiers(fmla5, 'y', g)
    set([])
    >>> 

That is, there is no person that is admired by everybody. Taking a
different open formula, ``fmla6``, we can verify that there is a
person, namely Bruce, who is admired by both Julia and Bruce.

    >>> fmla6 = lp.parse('(person(y) & all x.((x = bruce | x = julia) -> admire(x, y)))')
    >>> m2.satisfiers(fmla6, 'y', g)
    set(['b'])

.. note:: |TRY|
   Devise a new model based on ``m2`` such that scope2a_
   comes out false in your model; similarly, devise a new model such that scope2b_
   comes out true.

----------------------------
Evaluating English Sentences
----------------------------

Using the ``sem`` Feature
-------------------------

In Section [REF] we briefly illustrated a method of
building semantic representations on the basis of a syntactic parse,
using the grammar framework developed in Chapter chap-featgram_. This
time, rather than constructing an SQL query, we will build a logical
form.  sem1_ illustrates a first approximation to the kind of analyses
we would like to build.

.. _sem1:
.. ex::
   .. tree:: (S[sem=\<\bark\(cyril\)\>](NP[sem=\<\(cyril\)\>] Cyril)(VP[sem=\<\bark\>] (V[sem=\<\bark\>] barks)))

In sem1_, the ``sem`` value at the root node shows a semantic
representation for the whole sentence, while the ``sem`` values at
lower nodes show semantic representations for constituents of the
sentence. Since the values of ``sem`` have to be treated in special
manner, they are distinguished from other feature values by being
enclosed in angle brackets. 

So far, so good, but how do we write grammar rules which will give us
this kind of result? Our approach will be similar to that adopted for
the grammar ``sql0.fcfg`` at the start of this chapter, in that we
will assign semantic representations to lexical nodes, and then
compose the semantic representations for phrases from those of the
daughters. However, in the present case we will use function
application rather than string concatenation as the mode of
composition. To be more specific, suppose we have a `np`:gc: and
`vp`:gc: constituents with appropriate values for their ``sem``
nodes. Then the ``sem`` value of an `s`:gc: is handled by a rule like
sem2_. (Observe that in the case where the value of ``sem`` is a
variable, we omit the angle brackets.)

.. _sem2:
.. ex::
   ::

     S[sem = <?vp(?np)>] -> NP[sem=?subj] VP[sem=?vp]

sem2_ tells us that given some ``sem`` value ``?subj`` for the subject
`np`:gc: and some ``sem`` value ``?vp`` for the `vp`:gc:, the ``sem``
value of the `s`:gc: mother is constructed by applying ``?vp`` as a
functor to ``?np``.  From this, we can conclude that ``?vp`` has to
denote a function which has the denotation of ``?np`` in its
domain. sem2_ is a nice example of
building semantics using the principle of compositionality.

To complete the grammar is very straightforward; all we require are the
rules shown in sem3_.

.. _sem3:
.. ex::
   ::

     VP[sem=?v] -> IV[sem=?v]
     NP[sem=<cyril>] -> 'Cyril'
     IV[sem=<bark>] -> 'barks'

The `vp`:gc: rule says that the mother's semantics is the same as the
head daughter's. The two lexical rules just introduce non-logical
constants to serve as the semantic values of `Cyril`:lx: and
`barks`:lx: respectively. 

Quantified NPs
--------------

You might be thinking this is all too easy |mdash| surely there is a
bit more to building compositional semantics. What about quantifiers,
for instance? Right, this is a crucial issue. For example, we want
sem5a_ to be given the logical form in sem5b_. How can this
be accomplished? 

.. _sem5: 
.. ex::
   .. _sem5a:
   .. ex:: 
      A dog barks.
   .. _sem5b:
   .. ex:: 
      ``'exists x.(dog(x) & (bark(x))'``

Let's make the assumption that our `only`:em: operation for building
complex semantic representations is function
application. Then our problem is this: how do we give a semantic
representation to the quantified `np`:gc:\ s `a dog`:lx: so that
it can be combined with ``'bark'`` to give the result
in sem5b_? As a first step, let's make the subject's ``sem`` value
act as the functor rather than the argument. (This is sometimes called
`type-raising`:dt:.) Now we are
looking for way of instantiating ``?np`` so that sem6a_ is equivalent
to sem6b_.

.. _sem6: 
.. ex::

   .. _sem6a:
   .. ex:: ``[sem=<?np(bark)>]``

   .. _sem6b:
   .. ex:: ``[sem=<exists x.(dog(x) & bark(x))>]``


This is where |lambda| abstraction comes to the rescue;
doesn't sem6_ look a bit reminiscent of carrying out |beta|-reduction
in the |lambda|-calculus? In other words, we want a |lambda| term
`M`:mathit: to replace ``'?np'`` so that applying `M`:mathit: to
``'bark'`` yields sem5b_.  To do this, we replace the occurence of
``'bark'`` in sem5b_ by a predicate variable ``'P'``, and bind the variable with
|lambda|, as shown in sem7_.

.. _sem7: 
.. ex:: ``'\P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x))'``

We have used a different style of variable in
sem7_ |mdash| that is ``'P'`` rather than ``'x'`` or ``'y'`` |mdash| to signal
that we are abstracting over a different kind of thing |mdash| not an
individual, but a function of type <e, t>. So the type of
sem7_ as a whole is <<e, t>, t>. We
will take this to be the type of `np`:gc:\ s in general. To illustrate
further, a universally quantified `np`:gc: will look like sem7univ_.

.. _sem7univ: 
.. ex:: ``'\P.all x.(dog(x) -> P(x))'``


We are pretty much done now, except that we also want to carry out a
further abstraction plus application for the process of combining the
semantics of the determiner `a`:lx: namely sem8_ with the semantics of
`dog`:lx:.

.. _sem7det: 
.. ex:: ``'\Q P.exists x.(Q(x) & P(x))'``

Applying sem8_ as a functor to ``'dog'`` yields sem7_, and applying
that to ``'bark'`` gives us 
``'(\P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x)))(bark)'``. Finally, carrying out |beta|\-reduction 
yields just what we wanted, namely sem5b_.


|NLTK| provides some utilities to make it easier to derive and inspect
semantic interpretations. ``text_interpret()`` is intended for batch
interpretation of a list of input sentences. It builds a dictionary
``d`` where for each sentence ``sent`` in the input,
``d[sent]`` is a list of paired trees and semantic representations for
``sent``. The value itself is a list, since ``sent`` may be syntactically
ambiguous; in the following example, however, there is only one parse
tree in the list.

    >>> result  = nltk.sem.text_interpret(['a dog barks'], 'grammars/sem1.fcfg')
    >>> for (syntree, semrep) in result['a dog barks']:
    ...     print syntree
    (S[sem=<exists x.(dog(x) & bark(x))>]
      (NP[sem=<\P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x))>]
        (Det[sem=<\Q P.exists x.(Q(x) & P(x))>] a)
        (N[sem=<dog>] dog))
      (VP[sem=<\x.bark(x)>] (IV[sem=<\x.bark(x)>] barks)))




Transitive Verbs
----------------

Our next challenge is to deal with sentences containing transitive
verbs, such as sem8_.

.. _sem8: 
.. ex:: Angus owns a dog.

The output semantics that we want to build is shown in sem9_.

.. _sem9: 
.. ex:: ``'exists x.(dog(x) & own(angus, x))'``

Let's look at how we can use |lambda|-abstraction to get this
result. A significant constraint on possible solutions is to require
that the semantic representation of `a dog`:lx: be independent of
whether the `np`:gc: acts as subject or object of the sentence. In
other words, we want to get sem9_ as our output while sticking to
sem7_ as the `np`:gc: semantics. A second constraint is that
`vp`:gc:\s should have a uniform type of interpretation regardless
of whether they consist of just an intransitive verb or a transitive
verb plus object. More specifically, we stipulate that `vp`:gc:\s
always denote characteristic functions on individuals. Given these
constraints, here's a semantic representation for `owns a dog`:lx:
which does the trick.

.. _sem99: 
.. ex:: ``'\y.exists x.(dog(x) & chase(y, x))'``

Think of sem99_ as the property of being a `y`:math: such that
for some dog `x`:math:, `y`:math: chases `x`:math:; or more
colloquially, being a `y`:math: who chases a dog. Our task now
resolves to designing a semantic representation for
`chases`:lx: which can combine via ``app`` with sem7_ so as to allow
sem99_ to be derived. 

Let's carry out a kind of inverse |beta|-reduction on sem99_,
giving rise to sem10_.

Then we are part
way to the solution if we can derive sem10_, where ``'X'`` is applied to
``'\z.chase(y, z)'``.

.. _sem10: 
.. ex:: ``'\P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x))(\z.chase(y, z))'``

sem10_ may be slightly hard to read at first; you need to see that
it involves applying the quantified `np`:gc: representation from 
sem7_ to ``'\z.chase(y,z))'``. sem10_ is of course 
equivalent to sem99_.

Now let's replace the functor in sem10_ by a variable ``'X'`` of the
same type as an `np`:gc:; that is, of type ((**Ind** |rarr| **Bool**)
|rarr| **Bool**). 

.. _sem11: 
.. ex:: ``'X(\z.chase(y, z))'``

The representation of a transitive verb will have to apply to
an argument of the type of ``'X'`` to yield a functor of the type of
`vp`:gc:\ s, that is, of type (**Ind** |rarr| **Bool**). We can ensure
this by abstracting over both the ``'X'`` variable in sem11_ and also
the subject variable ``'y'``. So the full solution is reached by
giving `chases`:lx: the semantic representation shown in sem12_.

.. _sem12: 
.. ex:: ``'\X y.X(\x.chase(y, x))'``

If sem12_ is applied to sem7_, the result after |beta|-reduction is
equivalent to sem99_, which is what we wanted all along:

.. ex:: | ``'(\X y.(X \x.(chase(y, x)) \P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x))'``
        | |reduce|
        | ``'(\y.(\P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x)) \x.chase(y, x))'``
	| |reduce|
        | ``'\y.(exists x.(dog(x) & chase(y, x)))'``

In order to build a semantic representation for a sentence, we also
need to combine in the semantics of the subject `np`:gc:. If the
latter is a quantified expression like `every girl`:lx:, everything
proceeds in the same way as we showed for `a dog barks`:lx: earlier
on; the subject is translated as a functor which is applied to the
semantic representation of the `vp`:gc:.  However, we now seem to have
created another problem for ourselves with proper names. So far, these
have been treated semantically as individual constants, and these
cannot be applied as functors to expressions like
sem99_. Consequently, we need to come up with a different semantic
representation for them. What we do
in this case is re-interpret proper names so that they too are
functors, like quantified `np`:gc:\ s. sem13_ shows the required
|lambda| expression for `Suzie`:lx:.

.. _sem13: 
.. ex:: ``'\P.P(suzie)'``

sem13_ denotes the characteristic function corresponding to the set of
all properties which are true of Suzie. Converting from an individual
constant to an expression like sem12_ is known as `type raising`:dt:,
and allows us to flip functors with arguments. That is, type raising
means that we can replace a Boolean-valued application such as 
`f(a`:mathit:) with an equivalent application 
`(`:math:\ |lambda|\ `P.P(a))(f`:mathit:).





Extracting Valuations from Chat-80
----------------------------------

Building ``Valuation`` objects by hand becomes rather tedious once we
consider larger examples. This raises the question of whether the
relation data in a ``Valuation`` could be extracted from some
pre-existing source. The ``corpora.chat80`` module
provides an example of extracting data from the Chat-80 Prolog
knowledge base (which included as part of the |NLTK| ``corpora``
distribution).

Chat-80 data is organized into collections of clauses, where each
collection functions as a table in a relational database. The
predicate of the clause provides the name of the table; the first
element of the tuple acts as the
'key'; and subsequent elements are further columns in the
table. 

In general, the name of the table provides a label for a unary
relation whose extension is all the keys. For example,
the table in ``cities.pl`` contains triples such as city_.

.. _city:
.. ex:: ``'city(athens,greece,1368).'``

Here, ``'athens'`` is the key, and will be mapped to a member of the
unary relation `city`:mathit:.

The other two columns in the table are mapped to binary relations, where the first
argument of the relation is filled by the table key, and the
second argument is filled by the data in the relevant column. Thus, in
the ``city`` table illustrated by the tuple in 
city_, the data from the third column is extracted  into a binary predicate
`population_of`:mathit:, whose extension is a set of pairs such as
``'(athens, 1368)'``.

In order to encapsulate the results of the extraction, a class of
``Concept``\ s is introduced.  A ``Concept`` object has a number of
attributes, in particular a ``prefLabel`` and ``extension``, which
make it easier to inspect the output of the extraction. The
``extension`` of a ``Concept`` object is incorporated into a
``Valuation`` object.

As well as deriving unary and binary relations from the Chat-80 data,
we also create a set of individual constants, one for each entity in
the domain. The individual constants are string-identical to the
entities. For example, given a data item such as ``'zloty'``, we add
to the valuation a pair ``('zloty', 'zloty')``. In order to parse
English sentences that refer to these entities, we also create a
lexical item such as the following for each individual constant:

.. ex::
   ::

     PropN[num=sg, sem=<\P.P(zloty)>] -> 'Zloty'

The ``chat80`` module can be found in the ``examples`` package. The
attribute ``chat80.items`` gives us a list of Chat-80 relations:

   >>> from nltk.examples.semantics import chat80
   >>> chat80.items # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ('borders', 'circle_of_lat', 'circle_of_long', 'city', ...)

The ``concepts()`` method shows the list of ``Concept``\ s that can be
extracted from a ``chat80`` relation, and we can then inspect their extensions.

   >>> concepts = chat80.concepts('city')
   >>> concepts
   [Concept('city'), Concept('country_of'), Concept('population_of')]
   >>> rel = concepts[1].extension
   >>> list(rel)[:5]
   [('chungking', 'china'), ('karachi', 'pakistan'), 
   ('singapore_city', 'singapore'), ('athens', 'greece'), 
   ('birmingham', 'united_kingdom')]

In order to convert such an extension into a valuation, we use the
``make_valuation()`` method; setting ``read=True`` creates and returns
a new ``Valuation`` object which contains the results.

   >>> val = nltk.corpus.chat80.make_valuation(concepts, read=True)
   >>> val['city']['calcutta']
   True
   >>> val['country_of']['india']
   {'hyderabad': True, 'delhi': True, 'bombay': True, 
   'madras': True, 'calcutta': True}
   >>> dom = val.domain
   >>> g = nltk.sem.Assignment(dom)
   >>> m = nltk.sem.Model(dom, val)
   >>> m.evaluate(r'\x .population_of(jakarta, x)', g)
   {'533': True}



------------------
Underspecification
------------------

One important limitation of the approach we have presented here is
that it does not attempt to deal with scope ambiguity. Instead,
quantifier scope ordering directly reflects scope in the parse
tree. As a result, a sentence like scope1_, repeated here, will always
be translated as scope12a_, not scope12b_.

.. _scope11:
.. ex:: Every girl chases a dog.

.. _scope12:
.. ex::

   .. _scope12a:
   .. ex:: ``'all x.(girl(x) -> exists y. (dog(y) & chase(x,y)))'``

   .. _scope12b:
   .. ex:: ``'exists y. dog(y) & all x. (girl(x) -> chase(x,y)))'``



Cooper Storage
--------------


Hole Semantics
--------------

This limitation can be overcome, for example using the hole semantics
described in [Blackburn2005RIN]_, but discussing the details would take
us outside the scope of the current chapter.

Hole Semantics in |NLTK| is handled by the
``nltk.sem.hole`` module, which uses a context free grammar to
generate an underspecified logical form.  Since the latter is itself a
formula of first order logic, we can continue to use the ``sem`` feature
in the context free grammar:

.. ex::
    N[sem=<\x h l.(PRED(l,dog,x) & LEQ(l,h) & HOLE(h) & LABEL(l))>] -> 'dog'

The Hole Semantics module uses a standard plugging algorithm to derive the
sentence's readings from the underspecified LF.

    >>> from nltk.sem import hole
    >>> readings = hole.main('every girl chases a dog')
    >>> for r in reading: print r
    exists z1.(dog(z1) & all z2.(girl(z2) -> chase(z1,z2)))
    all z2.(girl(z2) -> exists z1.(dog(z1) & chase(z1,z2)))


.. TO-DO: rejig to accommodate scope ambiguity

Now that we have looked at some slightly more complex constructions, we can
evaluate them in a model. In the following example, we derive two
parses for the sentence `every boy chases a girl in Noosa`:lx:, and
evaluate each of the corresponding semantic representations in the
model ``model0.py`` which we have imported.

    >>> grammar = nltk.data.load('grammars/sem2.fcfg')
    >>> val4 = nltk.data.load('grammars/valuation1.val')
    >>> dom4 = val4.domain
    >>> m4 = nltk.sem.Model(dom4, val4)
    >>> g = nltk.sem.Assignment(dom4)
    >>> sent = 'every boy chases a girl in Noosa'
    >>> result = nltk.sem.text_evaluate([sent], grammar, m4, g)
    >>> for (syntree, semrep, value) in result[sent]:
    ... 	print "'%s' is %s in Model m\n" % (semrep, value)
    'all x.(boy(x) -> (exists z2.(girl(z2) & chase(x,z2)) & in(x,noosa)))' is True in Model m
    <BLANKLINE>
    'all x.(boy(x) -> (exists z2.(girl(z2) & chase(x,z2)) & in(x,noosa)))' is True in Model m
    <BLANKLINE>
    'all x.(boy(x) -> exists z3.((girl(z3) & in(z3,noosa)) & chase(x,z3)))' is False in Model m
    <BLANKLINE>
    'all x.(boy(x) -> exists z3.((girl(z3) & in(z3,noosa)) & chase(x,z3)))' is False in Model m
    <BLANKLINE>



---------------
Inference tools
---------------

In order to perform inference over semantic representations, |NLTK|
can call both theorem provers and model builders.
The library includes a pure Python tableau-based first order theorem prover;
this is intended to allow students to study 
tableau methods for theorem proving, and provides an
opportunity for experimentation.  In addition, |NLTK| provides
interfaces to two state-of-the-art tools, namely the theorem prover Prover9, 
and the model builder Mace4  [McCune]_.  

The ``get_prover(G, A)`` method by default calls Prover9, and takes as
parameters a proof goal ``G`` and a list ``A`` of assumptions.
Here, we verify that if every dog barks, and Rover is a dog,
then it is true that Rover barks:

    >>> from nltk.inference import inference
    >>> a = lp.parse('all x.(dog(x) -> bark(x))')
    >>> b = lp.parse('dog(rover)')
    >>> c = lp.parse('bark(rover)')
    >>> prover = inference.get_prover(c, [a,b])
    >>> prover.prove()
    True


A theorem prover can also be used to check the logical equivalence of
expressions.  For two expressions *A* and *B*, we can pass (*A* |iff|
*B*) into a theorem prover and know that the theorem will be proved if
and only if the expressions are logically equivalent.  |NLTK|\ 's
standard equality operator for ``Expression``\ s (``==``) is able to
handle situations where two expressions are identical up to
|alpha|-conversion.  However, it would be impractical for |NLTK| to
invoke a wider range of logic rules every time we checked for equality
of two expressions. Consequently, both the ``logic`` and ``drt``
modules in |NLTK| have a separate method, ``tp_equals``, for checking
'equality' up to logical equivalence.

    >>> a = lp.parse('all x.walk(x)')
    >>> b = lp.parse('all y.walk(y)')
    >>> a == b
    True
    >>> c = lp.parse('-(P(x) & Q(x))')
    >>> d = lp.parse('-P(x) | -Q(x)')
    >>> c == d
    False
    >>> c.tp_equals(d)
    True

Discourse Semantics
-------------------


Discourse Representation Theory
-------------------------------

The ``nltk.sem.drt`` module introduces
a ``DRS()`` constructor which takes lists of discourse referents
and conditions as initialization parameters:

.. ex::
    DRS([j,d],[John(j), dog(d), sees(j,d)])

On top of the functionality available for |FOL|
expressions, |DRT| expressions have a |DRS|\ -concatenation operator,
represented as the ``+`` symbol.  The concatenation of two |DRS|\ s
is a single |DRS| containing the merged discourse referents and the
conditions from both arguments.  |DRS|\ -concatenation automatically
|alpha|\ -converts bound variables to avoid name-clashes.  The
``+`` symbol is overloaded so that |DRT| expressions can be added
together easily.  The ``nltk.sem.drt`` parser allows |DRS|\ s to be
specified succinctly as strings.

    >>> from nltk.sem import drt
    >>> dp = drt.DrtParser()
    >>> d1 = dp.parse('([x],[walk(x)]) + ([y],[run(y)])')
    >>> print d1
    (([x],[walk(x)]) + ([y],[run(y)]))
    >>> print d1.simplify()
    ([x,y],[walk(x), run(y)])
    >>> d2 = dp.parse('([x,y],[Bill(x), Fred(y)])')
    >>> d3 = dp.parse("""([],[([u],[Porsche(u), own(x,u)])
    ...  ->  ([v],[Ferrari(v), own(y,u)])])""")
    >>> d4 = d2 + d3
    >>> print d4.simplify()
    ([x,y],[Bill(x), Fred(y), (([u],[Porsche(u), own(x,u)]) -> ([v],[Ferrari(v), own(y,u)]))])

|DRT| expressions can be converted to their first order predicate
logic equivalents using the ``toFol()`` method and can be
graphically rendered on screen with the ``draw()`` method.

    >>> print d1.toFol()
    (exists x.walk(x) & exists y.run(y))
    >>> d4.simplify().draw()

Since the |lambda| operator can be combined with |DRT| expressions,
the ``nltk.sem.drt`` module can be used as a plug-in replacement for 
``nltk.sem.logic`` in building compositional semantics.




Discourse Processing
--------------------

|NLTK| contains a discourse processing module,
``nltk.inference.discourse``, similar to the CURT program
presented in [Blackburn2005RIN]_.  This module processes sentences incrementally,
keeping track of all possible threads when there is ambiguity. For
simplicity, the following example ignores scope ambiguity.

    >>> from nltk.inference.discourse import DiscourseTester as DT
    >>> dt = DT(['A student dances', 'Every student is a person'])
    >>> dt.readings()
    <BLANKLINE>
    s0 readings:
    ------------------------------
    s0-r0: exists x.(student(x) & dance(x))
    <BLANKLINE>
    s1 readings:
    ------------------------------
    s1-r0: all x.(student(x) -> person(x))

When a new sentence is added to the current discourse, setting the
parameter ``consistchk=True`` causes consistency to be checked
by invoking the model checker for each 'thread', i.e., discourse sequence of
admissible readings. In this case, the user has the option
of retracting the sentence in question.

    >>> dt.add_sentence('No person dances', consistchk=True)
    Inconsistent discourse d0 ['s0-r0', 's1-r0', 's2-r0']:
    s0-r0: exists x.(student(x) & dance(x))
    s1-r0: all x.(student(x) -> person(x))
    s2-r0: -exists x.(person(x) & dance(x))
    >>> dt.retract_sentence('No person dances', quiet=False)
    Current sentences are 
    s0: A student dances
    s1: Every student is a person

In a similar manner, we use ``informchk=True`` to check whether
the new sentence is informative relative to the current discourse (by
asking the theorem prover to derive it from the discourse).

    >>> dt.add_sentence('A person dances', informchk=True)
    Sentence 'A person dances' under reading 'exists x.(person(x) & dance(x))':
    Not informative relative to thread 'd0'

It is also possible to pass in an additional set of assumptions as
background knowledge and use these to filter out inconsistent readings.

The ``discourse`` module can accommodate semantic 
ambiguity and filter out readings that are not admissable.
By invoking both Glue Semantics and |DRT|, the following example processes the 
two-sentence discourse `Every dog chases a boy.  He runs`lx:.  As
shown, the first sentence has two possible readings, while 
the second sentence contains an anaphoric pronoun, indicated as ``PRO(x)``.


    >>> from nltk.inference.discourse import DrtGlueReadingCommand as RC
    >>> dt = DT(['Every dog chases a boy', 'He runs'], RC())
    >>> dt.readings()
    <BLANKLINE>
    s0 readings:
    ------------------------------
    s0-r0: ([],[(([x],[dog(x)]) -> ([z15],[boy(z15), chase(x,z15)]))])
    s0-r1: ([z16],[boy(z16), (([x],[dog(x)]) -> ([],[chase(x,z16)]))])
    <BLANKLINE>
    s1 readings:
    ------------------------------
    s1-r0: ([x],[PRO(x), run(x)])

When we examine the two threads ``d0`` and ``d1``, we see
that that reading ``s0-r0``, where `every dog`:lx: out-scopes
``a boy``, is deemed inadmissable because the pronoun in the
second sentence cannot be resolved.  By contrast, in thread ``d1`` the
pronoun (relettered to ``z24``) has been bound \textit{via} the
equation ``(z24 = z20)``.  

Inadmissable readings are filtered out by passing the parameter
``filter=True``.

    >>> dt.readings(show_thread_readings=True)
    d0: ['s0-r0', 's1-r0'] : INVALID: AnaphoraResolutionException
    d1: ['s0-r1', 's1-r0'] : ([z20,z24],[boy(z20), (([x],[dog(x)]) -> 
    ([],[chase(x,z20)])), (z24 = z20), run(z24)])
    >>> dt.readings(filter=True, show_thread_readings=True)
    d1: ['s0-r1', 's1-r0'] : ([z26,z29],[boy(z26), (([x],[dog(x)]) -> 
    ([],[chase(x,z26)])), (z29 = z26), run(z29)])

    >>> dt.readings(show_thread_readings=True)
    d0: ['s0-r0', 's1-r0'] : INVALID: AnaphoraResolutionException
    d1: ['s0-r1', 's1-r0'] : ([z20,z24],[boy(z20), (([x],[dog(x)]) -> 
    ([],[chase(x,z20)])), (z24 = z20), run(z24)])




Anaphora Resolution
-------------------

|NLTK| also includes a extension to the DRT module that allows the
user to resolve anaphoric pronouns, located in
``nltk.sem.drt\_resolve\_anaphora``.  For instance, the three sentence
discourse `John walks.  Bill runs.  He talks.`:lx: is shown below, along
with its resolution.  The anaphora resolution procedure used by |NLTK|
replaces any instance of the function ``PRO(x)`` with an expression
equating ``x`` to a list of possible antecedents of ``x``.  The list of
possible antecedents contains any discourse referent in an accessible
DRS.


    >>> d = drtparse(r'DRS([j,b,x],[(John=j), walk(j), (Bill=b), 
    run(b), PRO(x), talk(x)])')
    >>> print d.resolve_anaphora()
    DRS([j,b,x],[(John=j), walk(j), (Bill=b), run(b), (x=[j,b]), 
    talk(x)])


The anaphora resolution logic has been separated into a separate
module so that users may write their own anaphora resolution
procedures and swap them in.

Summary
-------

* Semantic Representations (SRs) for English are constructed using a
  language based on the |lambda|-calculus, together with Boolean
  connectives, equality, and first-order quantifiers.

* |beta|-reduction in the |lambda|-calculus corresponds semantically
  to application of a function to an argument. Syntactically, it
  involves replacing a variable bound by |lambda| in the functor with
  the expression that provides the argument in the function
  application.

* If two |lambda|-abstracts differ only in the label of the variable
  bound by |lambda|, they are said to be |alpha|
  equivalents. Relabeling a variable bound by a |lambda| is called
  |alpha|-conversion.

* Currying of a binary function turns it into a unary function whose
  value is again a unary function.

* |FSRL| has both a syntax and a semantics. The semantics is
  determined by recursively evaluating expressions in a model.

* A key part of constructing a model lies in building a valuation
  which assigns interpretations to non-logical constants. These are
  interpreted as either curried characteristic functions or as
  individual constants. 

* The interpretation of Boolean connectives is handled by the
  model; these are interpreted as characteristic functions.

* An open expression is an expression containing one or more free
  variables. Open expressions only receive an interpretation when
  their free variables receive values from a
  variable assignment.

* Quantifiers are interpreted by constructing, for a formula |phi|\
  [`x`:mathit:\ ] open in variable `x`:mathit:, the set of individuals
  which make |phi|\ [`x`:mathit:\ ] true when an assignment *g*
  assigns them as the value of `x`:mathit:. The quantifier then places
  constraints on that set.

* A closed expression is one that has no free variables; that is, the
  variables are all bound. A closed sentence is true or
  false with respect to all variable assignments.

* Given a formula with two nested quantifiers *Q*\ :sub:`1` and *Q*\
  :sub:`2`, the outermost quantifier *Q*\ :sub:`1` is said to have wide
  scope (or scope over *Q*\ :sub:`2`). English sentences are frequently
  ambiguous with respect to the scope of the quantifiers they
  contain. 

* English sentences can be associated with an SR by treating ``sem``
  as a feature. The ``sem`` value of a complex expressions typically
  involves functional application of the ``sem`` values of the
  component expressions.

* Model valuations need not be built by hand, but can also be
  extracted from relational tables, as in the Chat-80 example.

The use of characteristic functions for interpreting expressions of
natural language was primarily due to Richard
Montague. [Dowty1981IMS]_ gives a comprehensive and reasonably
approachable introduction to Montague's grammatical framework.

A more recent and wide-reaching study of the use of a |lambda| based
approach to natural language can be found in [Carpenter1997TLS]_.

[Heim1998SGG]_ is a thorough application of formal semantics to
transformational grammars in the Government-Binding model.

[Blackburn2005RIN]_ is the first textbook devoted to computational
semantics, and provides an excellent introduction to the area.

Exercises

1. |soso| Modify the ``sem.evaluate`` code so that it will
   give a helpful error message if an expression is not in the domain
   of a model's valuation function.

#. |hard| Specify and implement a typed functional language with quantifiers,
   Boolean connectives and equality. Modify
   ``sem.evaluate`` to interpret expressions of this language.

#. |hard| Extend the ``chat80`` code so that it will extract data from a
   relational database using SQL queries.

#. |hard| Taking [WarrenPereira1982] as a starting point, develop a technique
   for converting a natural language query into a form that can be
   evaluated more efficiently in a model. For example, given a query
   of the form ``'(P(x) & Q(x)'``, convert it to ``'(Q(x) & P(x)'`` if
   the extension of ``'Q'`` is smaller than the extension of 
   ``'P'``.
