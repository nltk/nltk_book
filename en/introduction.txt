1. Introduction to Natural Language Processing
==============================================

---------------------------------
Why Language Processing is Useful
---------------------------------

How do we write programs to manipulate natural language?  What
questions about language could we answer?  How would the programs
work, and what data would they need?  These are just some of the
topics we will cover in this book.  Before we tackle the subject
systematically, we will take a quick look at some simple tasks in
which computational tools manipulate language data in a variety of
interesting and non-trivial ways.

..  
    Even if you are not familiar with programming or with the Python
    language, we hope you will still gain a sense of what these
    programs do.  Later chapters will explore the operation of these
    and other programs in depth.

Our first example involves word stress. The `CMU Pronunciation
Dictionary <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict>`_ is a
machine-readable dictionary that gives the pronunciation of over
125,000 words in North American English. Each entry consists of a word
in standard orthography followed by a phonological transcription.  For
example, the entry for `language`:lx: is the following:

.. ex::

    language / L AE1 NG G W AH0 JH .

Each character or group of characters following the slash represents
an English phoneme, and the final numbers indicate word stress.
That is, 'AE1' is the nucleus of a stressed syllable,
while 'AH0' is the nucleus of an unstressed one.
Let's suppose that we want to find every word in the dictionary
which exhibits a particular stress pattern; say, words whose primary
stress is on their fifth-last syllable (this is called
`pre-preantepenultimate`:dt: stress). Searching through the dictionary
by hand would be tedious, and we would probably miss some of the
cases. We can write a simple program that will extract the numerals 0,
1 and 2 from transcription, and then creates a new field
``stress_pattern`` for each word which is just a sequence of these
stress numbers. After this has been done, it is easy to scan the
extracted stress patterns for any sequence which ends with ``1 0 0 0
0``. Here are some of the words that we can find using this method:

.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::

    ACCUMULATIVELY / AH0 K Y UW1 M Y AH0 L AH0 T IH0 V L IY0
    AGONIZINGLY / AE1 G AH0 N AY0 Z IH0 NG L IY0
    CARICATURIST / K EH1 R AH0 K AH0 CH ER0 AH0 S T
    CUMULATIVELY / K Y UW1 M Y AH0 L AH0 T IH0 V L IY0
    FORMALIZATION / F AO1 R M AH0 L AH0 Z EY0 SH AH0 N
    HYPERSENSITIVITY / HH AY2 P ER0 S EH1 N S AH0 T IH0 V AH0 T IY0
    IMAGINATIVELY / IH2 M AE1 JH AH0 N AH0 T IH0 V L IY0
    INSTITUTIONALIZES / IH2 N S T AH0 T UW1 SH AH0 N AH0 L AY0 Z AH0 Z
    SPIRITUALIST / S P IH1 R IH0 CH AH0 W AH0 L AH0 S T
    UNALIENABLE / AH0 N EY1 L IY0 EH0 N AH0 B AH0 L

----

Our second example also involves phonology. When we construct an
inventory of sounds for a language, we are usually interested in just
those sounds which can make a difference in word meaning. To do this,
we look for `minimal pairs`:dt:; that is, distinct words which differ
in only one sound. For example, we might argue that the sounds [p] and
[b] in English are distinctive because if we replace one with the
other, we often end up with a different word:

.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::

     **p**\ at vs. **b**\ at
     ni\ **p** vs. ni\ **b**

Suppose we want to do this more systematically for a language where we
have a list of words, but are still trying to determine the sound
inventory.  As a case in point, NLTK includes a lexicon for Rotokas,
an East Papuan language spoken on Bougainville Island, near Papua New
Guinea.  Let's suppose we are interested in how many vowels there are
in Rotokas. We can write a program to find all four-letter words which
differ only by their first vowel, and tabulate the results to
illustrate vowel contrasts:

.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::

    kasi -    kesi kusi kosi
    kava -    -    kuva kova
    karu kiru keru kuru koru
    kapu kipu -    -    kopu
    karo kiro -    -    koro
    kari kiri keri kuri kori
    kapa -    kepa -    kopa
    kara kira kera -    kora
    kaku -    -    kuku koku
    kaki kiki -    -    koki

----

The two preceding examples have used lexical resources.  We can also
write programs to analyze texts in various ways. In this example, we
try to build a model of the patterns of adjacent words in the book of
Genesis. Each pair of adjacent words is known as a `bigrams`:dt:, and
we can build a very simple model of biblical language just be counting
bigrams.  There are many useful things we can do with such
information, such as identifying genres of literature or even
identifying the author of a piece of text. Here we use it for a more
whimsical purpose: to generate random text in the style of Genesis.
As you will see, we have managed to capture something about the flow of
text from one word to the next, but beyond this it is simply nonsense:

.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::

    lo, it came to the land of his father and he said, i will not be a
    wife unto him, saying, if thou shalt take our money in their kind,
    cattle, in thy seed after these are my son from off any more than all
    that is this day with him into egypt, he, hath taken away unawares to
    pass, when she bare jacob said one night, because they were born two
    hundred years old, as for an altar there, he had made me out at her
    pitcher upon every living creature after thee shall come near her:
    yea,

----

For our last example, let's suppose we are engaged in research to
study semantic contrast in English verbs. We hypothesize that one
useful source of data for exploring such contrasts might be a list of
verb phrases which are conjoined with the word `but`:lx:. So we need
to carry out some grammatical analysis to find conjoined verb phrases,
and also need to be able to specify `but`:lx: as the
conjunction. Rather than trying to do the grammatical analysis
ourselves, we can make use of a resource in which the syntactic trees
have already been added to lots of sentences. The best known of such
resources is the `University of Pennsylvania Treebank corpus
<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/>`_ (or |PTB| for short), and we
can write a program to read trees from this corpus, find instances of
verb phrase conjunctions involving the word *but*, and display parsed
text corresponding to the two verb phrases.

.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::

    (VBZ has) (VP opened its market to foreign cigarettes)
      *BUT* (VBZ restricts) (NP advertising) (PP-CLR to designated places)
    (VBZ admits) (SBAR 0 she made a big mistake)
      *BUT* (VBD did) (RB n't) (VP elaborate)
    (VBD confirmed) (SBAR 0 he had consented to the sanctions)
      *BUT* (VBD declined) (S \*-1 to comment further)
    (VBP are) (NP-PRD a guide to general levels)
      *BUT* (VBP do) (RB n't) (ADVP-TMP always) (VP represent actual transactions)
    (VBN flirted) (PP with a conversion to tabloid format) (PP-TMP for years)
      *BUT* (ADVP-TMP never) (VBN executed) (NP the plan)
    (VBD ended) (ADVP-CLR slightly higher)
      *BUT* (VBD trailed) (NP gains in the Treasury market)
    (VBD confirmed) (NP the filing)
      *BUT* (MD would) (RB n't) (VP elaborate)

----

In presenting these examples, we have tried to give you a flavour of
the range of things that can be done with natural language using
computational tools. All the above examples were generated using
simple programming techniques and a small amount of Python code. After
working through the first few chapters of this book, you will be able
write such programs yourself. In the process, you will come to
understand the basics of `natural language processing`:dt: (henceforth
abbreviated as |NLP|) as a
subject. In the remainder of this chapter, we will give you more
reasons to think that |NLP| is both important and fun.

The Language Challenge
----------------------

Language is rich and complex
----------------------------

Language is the chief manifestation of human intelligence.  Through
language we express basic needs and lofty aspirations, technical
know-how and flights of fantasy.  Ideas are shared over great
separations of distance and time.  The following samples from English
illustrate the richness of language:


1.
  a. Overhead the day drives level and grey, hiding the sun by a flight
     of grey spears.  (William Faulkner, *As I Lay Dying*, 1935)
  b. When using the toaster please ensure that the exhaust fan is turned
     on. (sign in dormitory kitchen)
  c. Amiodarone weakly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4-mediated
     activities with Ki values of 45.1-271.6 |mu|\M (Medline, PMID: 10718780)
  d. Iraqi Head Seeks Arms (spoof news headline)
  e. The earnest prayer of a righteous man has great power and wonderful
     results. (James 5:16b)
  f. Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
     (Lewis Carroll, *Jabberwocky*, 1872)
  g. There are two ways to do this, AFAIK :smile:  (internet discussion archive)

Thanks to this richness, the study of language is part of many
disciplines outside of linguistics, including translation, literary
criticism, philosophy, anthropology and psychology.  Many less obvious
disciplines investigate language use, such as law, hermeneutics,
forensics, telephony, pedagogy, archaeology, cryptanalysis and speech
pathology.  Each applies distinct methodologies to gather
observations, develop theories and test hypotheses.  Yet all serve to
deepen our understanding of language and of the intellect which is
manifested in language.


The importance of language to science and the arts is matched in
significance by the cultural treasure embodied in language.
Each of the world's ~7,000 human languages is rich in unique respects,
in its oral histories and creation legends, down to its grammatical
constructions and its very words and their nuances of meaning.
Threatened remnant cultures have words to distinguish plant subspecies
according to therapeutic uses which are unknown to science.  Languages
evolve over time as they come into contact with each other and they
provide a unique window onto human pre-history.  Technological change
gives rise to new words like `blog`:lx: and new morphemes like `e-`:lx: and
`cyber-`:lx:.  In many parts of the world, small linguistic variations
from one town to the next add up to a completely different language in
the space of a half-hour drive.  For its breathtaking complexity and
diversity, human language is as a colourful tapestry stretching
through time and space.

.. TODO: the 'select' example seems a bit arbitrary

.. 
   Each new wave of computing technology has faced new challenges for
   language analysis.  Early machine languages gave way to high-level
   programming languages which are automatically parsed and interpreted.
   Databases are interrogated using linguistic expressions like ``SELECT
   age FROM employee``.  Recently, computing devices have become
   ubiquitous and are often equipped with multimodal interfaces
   supporting text, speech, dialogue and pen gestures.  One way or
   another, building new systems for natural linguistic interaction will
   require sophisticated language analysis.

Language and the Internet
-------------------------

Today, both professionals and ordinary people are confronted by
unprecedented volumes of information, the vast bulk of which is stored
as unstructured text. In 2003, it was estimated that the annual
production of books amounted to 8 Terabytes. (A Terabyte is 1,000
Gigabytes, i.e., equivalent to 1,000 pickup trucks filled with books.)
It would take a human being about five years to read the new
scientific material that is produced every 24 hours.  Although these
estimates are based on printed materials, increasingly the information
is also available electronically. Indeed, there has been an explosion of text
and multimedia content on the World Wide Web.  For many people, a
large and growing fraction of work and leisure time is spent
navigating and accessing this universe of information.

The presence of so much text in electronic form is a huge challenge to
|NLP|. Arguably, the only way for humans to cope with the information
explosion is to exploit computational techniques which can sift
through huge bodies of text. 

Although existing search engines have been crucial to the growth and
popularity of the Web, humans require skill, knowledge, and some luck,
to extract answers to such questions as `What tourist sites can I
visit between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on a limited budget?`:lx:
`What do expert critics say about Canon digital cameras?`:lx: `What
predictions about the steel market were made by credible commentators
in the past week?`:lx: Getting a computer to answer them automatically
is a realistic long-term goal, but would involve a range of language
processing tasks, including information extraction, inference, and
summarization, and would need to be carried out on a scale and with a
level of robustness that is still beyond our current capabilities.

The Promise of |NLP|
--------------------

As we have seen,  |NLP| is important
for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons.  |NLP| is
experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in
a variety of new language technologies.  For this reason it is
important for a wide range of people to have a working knowledge of
|NLP|.  Within academia, this includes people in areas from humanities
computing and corpus linguistics through to computer science and
artificial intelligence.  Within industry, it includes people in
human-computer interaction, business information analysis, and Web
software development.  We hope that you, a member of this diverse
audience reading these materials, will come to appreciate the workings
of this rapidly growing field of |NLP| and will apply its techniques in
the solution of real-world problems.  

The following chapters present a
carefully-balanced selection of theoretical foundations and practical
application, and equips readers to work with large datasets, to create
robust models of linguistic phenomena, and to deploy them in working
language technologies.  By integrating all of this into the Natural
Language Toolkit (|NLTK|), we hope this book opens up the exciting
endeavour of practical natural language processing to a broader
audience than ever before.

Language and Computtion
-----------------------

NLP and Intelligence
--------------------

A long-standing challenge within computer science has been to build
intelligent machines.  The chief measure of machine intelligence has
been a linguistic one, namely the Turing Test: can a dialogue system,
responding to a user's typed input with its own textual output,
perform so naturally that users cannot distinguish it from a human
interlocutor using the same interface?  Today, there is substantial
ongoing research and development in such areas as machine translation
and spoken dialogue, and significant commercial systems are in
widespread use.  The following dialogue illustrates a typical
application:

  | S: How may I help you?
  | U: When is Saving Private Ryan playing?
  | S: For what theater?
  | U: The Paramount theater.
  | S: Saving Private Ryan is not playing at the Paramount theater, but
  |  it's playing at the Madison theater at 3:00, 5:30, 8:00, and 10:30. 

Today's commercial dialogue systems are strictly limited to
narrowly-defined domains. We could not ask the above system to provide
driving instructions or details of nearby restaurants unless the
requisite information had already been stored and suitable question
and answer sentences had been incorporated into the language
processing system.  Observe that the above system appears to
understand the user's goals: the user asks when a movie is showing and
the system correctly determines from this that the user wants to see
the movie. This inference seems so obvious to humans that we usually
do not even notice it has been made, yet a natural language system
needs to be endowed with this capability in order to interact
naturally. Without it, when asked `Do you know when Saving Private
Ryan is playing`:lx:, a system might simply |mdash| and unhelpfully
|mdash| respond with a cold `Yes`:lx:. While it appears that this dialogue
system can perform simple inferences, such sophistication is only
found in cutting edge research prototypes.  Instead, the developers of
commercial dialogue systems use contextual assumptions and simple
business logic to ensure that the different ways in which a user might
express requests or provide information are handled in a way that
makes sense for the particular application.  Thus, whether the user
says `When is ...`:lx:, or `I want to know when ...`:lx:, or `Can you tell me
when ...`:lx:, simple rules will always yield screening times.  This is
sufficient for the system to provide a useful service.

Despite some recent advances, it is generally true that those natural
language systems which have been fully deployed still cannot perform
common-sense reasoning or draw on world knowledge.  We can wait for
these difficult artificial intelligence problems to be solved, but in
the meantime it is necessary to live with some severe limitations on
the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of natural language
systems. Accordingly, right from the beginning, an important goal of
|NLP| research has been to make progress on the holy grail of natural
linguistic interaction `without`:em: recourse to this unrestricted
knowledge and reasoning capability.  This is an old challenge, and so
it is instructive to review the history of the field.

Language and Symbol Processing
------------------------------

The very notion that natural language could be treated in a
computational manner grew out of a research program, dating back to
the early 1900s, to reconstruct mathematical reasoning using logic,
most clearly manifested in work by Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein,
Tarski, Lambek and Carnap.  This work led to the notion of language as
a formal system amenable to automatic processing.  Three later
developments laid the foundation for natural language processing.  The
first was `formal language theory`:dt:.  This defined a language as a set
of strings accepted by a class of automata, such as context-free
languages and pushdown automata, and provided the underpinnings for
computational syntax.

The second development was `symbolic logic`:dt:. This provided a
formal method for capturing selected aspects of natural language that
are relevant for expressing logical proofs. A formal calculus in
symbolic logic provides the syntax of a language, together with rules
of inference and, possibly, rules of interpretation in a set-theoretic
model; examples are propositional logic and First Order Logic.  Given
such a calculus, with a well-defined syntax and semantics, it becomes
possible to associate meanings with expressions of natural language by
translating them into expressions of the formal calculus. For example,
if we translate `John saw Mary`:lx: into a formula ``saw(j,m)``, we
(implicitly or explicitly) intepret the English verb `saw`:lx: as a
binary relation, and `John`:lx: and `Mary`:lx: as denoting
individuals.  More general statements like `All birds fly`:lx: require
quantifiers, in this case |forall|, meaning `for all`:lx:: |forall|\
`x (bird(x)`:math: |rarr| `fly(x))`:math:.  This use of logic provided
the technical machinery to perform inferences that are an important
part of language understanding.



A closely related development was the `principle of
compositionality`:dt:, namely that the meaning of a complex expression
is comprised of the meaning of its parts and their mode of
combination. This principle provided a useful correspondence between
syntax and semantics, namely that the meaning of a complex expression
could be computed recursively.  Consider the sentence `It is not true
that`:;x: `p`:math:, where `p`:math: is a proposition.  We can
represent the meaning of this sentence as `not(p)`:math:.  Similarly, we
can represent the meaning of `John saw Mary`:lx: as `saw(j, m)`:math:.  Now we
can compute the interpretation of `It is not true that John saw Mary`:lx:
recursively, using the above information, to get
`not(saw(j,m))`:math:. 


The approaches just outlined share the premise that computing with
natural language crucially relies on rules for manipulating symbolic
representations. For a certain period in the development of |NLP|,
particularly during the 1980s, this premise provided a common starting
point for both linguists and practioners of |NLP|, leading to a family
of grammar formalisms known as unification-based (or feature-based)
grammar, and to |NLP| applications implemented in the Prolog
programming language. Although grammar-based |NLP| is still a
significant area of research, it has become somewhat eclipsed in the
last 15\ |ndash|\ 20 years dues to a variety of factors. One
significant influence came from automatic speech recognition. Although
early work in speech processing adopted a model which emulated the
kind of rule-based phonological processing typified by Chomsky and
Halle's *SPE*, this turned out to be hopelessly inadequate in dealing
with the hard problem of recognizing actual speech in anything like
real time. By contrast, systems which involved learning patterns from
large bodies of speech data were significantly more accurate,
efficient and robust. In addition, the speech community found that
progress in building better systems was hugely assisted by the
construction of shared resources for quantitatively measuring
performance against common test data. Eventually, much of the |NLP|
community embraced a `data intensive`:dt: orientation to language
processing, coupled with a growing use of machine-learning techniques
and evaluation-led methodology.

..
   A separate strand of development in the 1960s and 1970s eschewed the
   principle of compositionality; it only seemed to get in the way of
   building practical systems.  Early questions answering systems that
   took this new approach would process a question such as *How many
   airports does London have?*, and discover that it matched the
   template *How many* -:subscript:`i` *does* -:subscript:`j` *have?*.
   Slot ``i`` would be constrained to be a feature or service, and slot
   ``j`` would be constrained to be a person or place.  Each
   template came with a predefined semantic function, such as
   ``count(i,j)``.  If a question matched the template, the
   corresponding semantic function would be "executed" to
   obtain an answer, ``k = count(i,j)``.  This answer would be
   substituted into a new template: -:subscript:`j` *has* -:subscript:`k`
   -:subscript:`i`.  The resulting text would be displayed for the user, e.g.:
   *London has five airports*.

   This approach to |NLP| is known as *semantic grammar*.  Such grammars
   are formalized like phrase-structure grammars, but their constituents
   are no longer grammatical categories such as *Noun Phrase*, but
   semantic categories like *Airport* and *City*.  These grammars work
   very well in limited domains, and are still widely used in spoken
   language systems.  However, they lack robustness and portability, and
   they mix up grammatical structure with semantic categories, making
   them hard to maintain.

Philosophical Divides
---------------------

The contrasting approaches to |NLP| described in the preceding section
relates back to early metaphysical debates about `rationalism`:dt:
versus `empiricism`:dt: and `realism`:dt: versus `idealism`:dt: that
occurred in the Enlightenment period of Western philosophy.  These
debates took place against a backdrop of orthodox thinking in which
the source of all knowledge was believed to be divine revelation.
During this period of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
philosophers argued that human reason or sensory experience has
priority over revelation.  Descartes and Leibniz, amongst others, took
the rationalist position, asserting that all truth has its origins in
human thought, and in the existence of 'innate ideas' implanted in our
minds from birth.  For example, they argued that the principles of
Euclidean geometry were developed using human reason, and were not the
result of supernatural revelation or sensory experience.  In contrast,
Locke and others took the empiricist view, that our primary source of
knowledge is the experience of our faculties, and that human reason
plays a secondary role in reflecting on that experience.  Prototypical
evidence for this position was Galileo's discovery |mdash| based on
careful observation of the motion of the planets |mdash| that the
solar system is heliocentric and not geocentric.  In the context of
linguistics, this debate leads to the following question: to what
extent does human linguistic experience, versus our innate 'language
faculty', provide the basis for our knowledge of language?  In |NLP|
this matter surfaces as differences in the priority of corpus data
versus linguistic introspection in the construction of computational
models.  We will return to this issue later in the book.

A further concern, enshrined in the debate between *realism* and
*idealism*, was the metaphysical status of the constructs of a theory.
Kant argued for a distinction between phenomena, the manifestations we
can experience, and "things in themselves" which can never been
known directly.  A linguistic realist would take a theoretical
construct like `noun phrase`:dt: to be real world entity that exists
independently of human perception and reason, and which actually
*causes* the observed linguistic phenomena.  A linguistic idealist, on
the other hand, would argue that noun phrases, along with more
abstract constructs like semantic representations, are intrinsically
unobservable, and simply play the role of useful fictions.  The way
linguists write about theories often betrays a realist position, while
|NLP| practitioners occupy neutral territory or else lean towards the
idealist position.  Thus, in |NLP|, it is often enough if a theoretical
abstraction leads to a useful result; it does not matter whether this
result sheds any light on human linguistic processing.

These issues are still alive today, and show up in the distinctions
between symbolic vs statistical methods, deep vs shallow processing,
binary vs gradient classifications, and scientific vs engineering
goals.  However, such contrasts are now highly nuanced, and the debate
is no longer as polarized as it once was.  In fact, most of the
discussions |mdash| and most of the advances even |mdash| involve a
'balancing act'.  For example, one intermediate position is to assume
that humans are innately endowed with analogical and memory-based
learning methods (weak rationalism), and use these methods to identify
meaningful patterns in their sensory language experience (empiricism).
For a more concrete illustration, consider the way in which statistics
from large corpora may serve as evidence for binary choices in a
symbolic grammar.  For instance, dictionaries describe the words
`absolutely`:lx: and `definitely`:lx: as nearly synonymous, yet their patterns
of usage are quite distinct when combined with a following verb, as
shown in Table absolutely_.

.. table:: absolutely

   +--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
   |    Google hits     |`adore`:lx: | `love`:lx:  |`like`:lx:   |`prefer`:lx:  |
   +--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
   |    `absolutely`:lx:|     289,000|       905,00|       16,200|           644|
   +--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
   |    `definitely`:lx:|       1,460|       51,000|      158,000|        62,600|
   +--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
   |               ratio|       198:1|         18:1|         1:10|          1:97|
   +--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+

   `Absolutely`:lx: vs `Definitely`:lx: (Liberman 2005, LanguageLog.org)

.. http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002022.html

As you will see, `absolutely adore`:lx: is about 200 times as popular as
`definitely adore`:lx:, while `absolutely prefer`:lx: is about 100 times rarer
then `definitely prefer`:lx:.  This information is used by statistical
language models, but it also counts as evidence for a symbolic account
of word combination in which `absolutely`:lx: can only modify extreme
actions or attributes, a property that could be represented as a
binary-valued feature of certain lexical items.  Thus, we see
statistical data informing symbolic models.  Once this information has
been codified symbolically, it is available to be exploited as a
contextual feature for statistical language modelling, alongside many
other rich sources of symbolic information, like hand-constructed
parse trees and semantic representations.  Now the circle is closed,
and we see symbolic information informing statistical models.

This new rapprochement is giving rise to many exciting new
developments.  We will touch on some of these in the ensuing pages.
We too will perform this balancing act, employing approaches to |NLP|
that integrate these historically-opposed philosophies and
methodologies.

------------------------------------------------
The Architecture of linguistic and |NLP| systems
------------------------------------------------

Generative Grammar and Modularity
---------------------------------

One of the intellectual descendants of formal language theory was the
linguistic framework known as `generative grammar`:dt:. Such a grammar
contains a set of rules that recursively specify (or `generate`) the
set of well-formed strings in a language. While there is a wide
spectrum of models which owe some allegiance to this core, Chomsky's
transformational grammar, in its various incarnations, is probably the
best known. In the Chomskyan tradition, it is claimed that humans have
distinct kinds of linguistic knowledge, organized into different
modules: for example, knowledge of a language's sound structure
(`phonology`:dt:), knowledge of word structure (`morphology`:dt:),
knowledge of phrase structure (`syntax`:dt:), and knowledge of meaning
(`semantics`:dt:). In a formal linguistic theory, each kind of
linguistic knowledge is made explicit as different `module`:dt: of the
theory, consisting of a collection of basic elements together with a
way of combining them into complex structures. For example, a
phonological module might provide a set of phonemes together with an
operation for concatenating phonemes into phonological
strings. Similarly, a syntactic module might provide labelled nodes as
primitives together wih a mechanism for assembling them into trees. A
set of linguistic primitives, together with some operators for
defining complex elements, is often called a `level of
representation`:dt:.

As well as defining modules, a generative grammar will prescribe how
the modules interact. For example, well-formed phonological strings
will provide the phonological content of words, and words will provide
the terminal elements of syntax trees. Well-formed syntactic trees
will be mapped to semantic representations, and contextual or
pragmatic information will ground these semantic representations in
some real-world situation.

As we indicated above, an important aspect of theories of generative
grammar is that they are intended to model the linguistic knowledge of
speakers and hearers; they are not intended to explain how humans
actually process linguistic information. This is, in part, reflected
in the claim that a generative grammer encodes the `competence`:dt: of an
idealized native speaker, rather than the speaker's `performance`:dt:. A
closely related distinction is to say that a generative grammar
encodes `declarative`:dt: rather than `procedural`:dt:
knowledge. Declarative knowledge can be glossed as 'knowing what',
whereas procedural knowledge is 'knowing how'.  As you
might expect, computational linguistics has the crucial role of
proposing procedural models of language. A central example is parsing,
where we have to develop computational mechanisms which convert
strings of words into structural representations such as syntax
trees. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that well-engineered
computational models of language contain both declarative and
procedural aspects. Thus, a full account of parsing will say how
declarative knowledge in the form of a grammar and lexicon combines
with procedural knowledge which determines how a syntactic analysis
should be assigned to a given string of words. This procedural
knowledge will be expressed as an `algorithm`:dt:\ : that is, an explicit
recipe for mapping some input into an appropriate output in a finite
number of steps.

A simple parsing algorithm for context-free grammars, for instance,
looks first for a rule of the form ``S`` |rarr| ``X``:subscript:`1` |cdots|
``X``:subscript:`n`, and builds a partial tree structure. It then steps
through the grammar rules one-by-one, looking for a rule of the form
``X``:subscript:`1` |rarr| ``Y``:subscript:`1` ...  ``Y``:subscript:`j` which
will expand the leftmost daughter introduced by the ``S`` rule, and
further extends the partial tree. This process continues, for example
by looking for a rule of the form ``Y``:subscript:`1` |rarr|
``Z``:subscript:`1` ...  ``Z``:subscript:`k` and expanding the partial tree
appropriately, until the leftmost node label in the partial tree is a
lexical category; the parser then checks to see if the first word of
the input can belong to the category. To illustrate, let's suppose
that the first grammer rule chosen by the parser is ``S`` |rarr| ``NP VP``
and the second rule chosen is ``NP`` |rarr| ``Det N``; then the partial
tree will be as follows:

.. tree:: (S (NP (Det \ ) (N)) (VP))

.. TODO: fix chapter cross reference below

If we assume that the input string we are trying to parse is `the cat
slept`:lx:, we will succeed in identifying `the`:lx: as a word which can
belong to the category `Det`:gc:. In this case, the parser goes on to
the next node of the tree, `N`:gc:, and next input word, `cat`:lx:. However,
if we had built the same partial tree with an input string `did the
cat sleep`:lx:, the parse would fail at this point, since `did`:lx: is not of
category `Det`:gc:.  The parser would throw away the structure built so
far and look for an alternative way of going from the `S`:gc: node down
to a leftmost lexical category (e.g., using a rule `S`:gc: |rarr| `V NP
VP`:gc:).
The important point for now is not the details of this or other
parsing algorithms; we discuss this topic much more fully in the
chapter on parsing. Rather, we just want to illustrate the idea that
an algorithm can be broken down into a fixed number of steps which
produce a definite result at the end.

In figure sds_ we further illustrate some of these points in
the context of a spoken dialogue system, such as our earlier example
of an application that offers the user information about movies
currently on show.

   Architecture of Spoken Dialogue System

Down the lefthand side of the diagram is a 'pipeline' of some
representative speech understanding `components`:dt:.  These map from
speech input *via* syntactic parsing to some kind of meaning
representation. Up the righthand side is an inverse pipeline of
components for concept-to-speech generation. These components
constitute the dynamic or procedural aspect of the system's natural language
processing. In the central column of the diagram are some
representative bodies of static information: the repositories of
language-related data which are called upon by the processing
components.

The
diagram illustrates that linguistically-motivated ways of
modularizing linguistic knowledge are often reflected in computational
systems. That is, the various components are organized so that the
data which they exchange corresponds roughly to different levels of
representation. For example, the output of the speech analysis
component will contain sequences of phonological representations of
words, and the output of the parser will be a semantic representation.
Of course the parallel is not precise, in part because it is often a
matter of practical expedience where to place the boundaries between
different processing components. For example, we can assume that
within the parsing component there is a level of syntactic
representation, although we have chosen not to expose this at the
level of the system diagram.  Despite such idiosyncracies, most |NLP|
systems break down their work into a series of discrete steps.  In the
process of natural language understanding, these steps go from more
concrete levels to more abstract ones, while in natural language
production, the direction is reversed.

An important aspect of learning |NLP| using these materials is to
experience both the challenge and |mdash| we hope |mdash| the
satisfaction of creating software to process natural language.  The
accompanying software, NLTK, is available for free and runs on most
operating systems including Linux/Unix, Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows.
You can download NLTK from <http://nltk.sourceforge.net/>, along
with extensive documentation.  We encourage you to install NLTK on
your machine before reading beyond the end of this chapter.
