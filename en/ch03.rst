3. Processing Raw Text
======================

The most important source of texts is undoubtedly the Web.  Its convenient
to have existing text collections to explore, such as the corpora we saw
in the previous chapters.  However, you probably have your own text sources
in mind, and need to learn how to access them.

The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

#. how can we write programs to access text from local files and
   from the web, in order to get hold of an unlimited range of
   language material?
#. how can we split documents up into individual words and
   punctuation symbols, so we can do the same kinds of
   analysis we did with text corpora in earlier chapters?
#. what features of the Python programming language are
   needed to do this?

In order to address these questions, we will be covering
key concepts in NLP, including tokenization and stemming.
Along the way you will consolidate your Python knowledge and
learn about strings, files, and regular expressions.  Since
so much text on the web is in |HTML| format, we will also
see how to dispense with markup.

.. Note:: From this chapter onwards, our program samples will assume you
   begin your interactive session or your program with: ``import nltk, re, pprint``

.. _sec-accessing-text:

Accessing Text from the Web and from Disk
-----------------------------------------

Electronic Books
----------------

A small sample of texts from Project Gutenberg appears in the |NLTK| corpus collection.
However, you may be interested in analyzing other texts from Project Gutenberg.
You can browse the catalog of 25,000 free online books at
``http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/``, and obtain a URL to an ASCII text file.
Although 90% of the texts in Project Gutenberg are in English, it
includes material in over 50 other languages, including Catalan, Chinese, Dutch,
Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish (with more than
100 texts each).

Text number 2554 is an English translation of *Crime and Punishment*,
and we can access it as follows:

    >>> from urllib import urlopen
    >>> url = "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2554/2554.txt"
    >>> raw = urlopen(url).read()
    >>> type(raw)
    <type 'str'>
    >>> len(raw)
    1176831
    >>> raw[:75]
    'The Project Gutenberg EBook of Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky\r\n'

.. note:: The read() process will take a few seconds as it downloads this large book.
   If you're using an internet proxy which is not correctly detected by Python,
   you may need to specify the proxy manually as follows:
   
       >>> proxies = {'http': 'http://www.someproxy.com:3128'}
       >>> raw = urllib.urlopen(url, proxies=proxies).read()
   
The variable ``raw`` contains a string with 1,176,831 characters.  This is the raw
content of the book, including many details we are not interested in such as
whitespace, line breaks and blank lines.  Instead, we want to break it up into
words and punctuation, as we saw in Chapter chap-introduction_.  This step is
called `tokenization`:dt:, and it produces our familiar structure, a list of words
and punctuation.  From now on we will call these `tokens`:dt:.

    >>> tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(raw)
    >>> type(tokens)
    <type 'list'>
    >>> text[:10]
    ['The', 'Project', 'Gutenberg', 'EBook', 'of', 'Crime', 'and', 'Punishment', ',', 'by']
    >>> len(text)
    255809

If we now take the further step of creating an |NLTK| text from this list, we can do
all of the other linguistic processing we saw in Chapter chap-introduction_, along with
the regular list operations like slicing:

    >>> text = nltk.Text(tokens)
    >>> type(text)
    <type 'nltk.text.Text'>
    >>> text[1020:1060]
    ['CHAPTER', 'I', 'On', 'an', 'exceptionally', 'hot', 'evening', 'early', 'in',
    'July', 'a', 'young', 'man', 'came', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'garret', 'in',
    'which', 'he', 'lodged', 'in', 'S', '.', 'Place', 'and', 'walked', 'slowly',
    ',', 'as', 'though', 'in', 'hesitation', ',', 'towards', 'K', '.', 'bridge', '.']
    >>> text.collocations()
    Katerina Ivanovna; Pulcheria Alexandrovna; Avdotya Romanovna; Pyotr
    Petrovitch; Project Gutenberg; Marfa Petrovna; Rodion Romanovitch;
    Sofya Semyonovna; Nikodim Fomitch; did not; Hay Market; Andrey
    Semyonovitch; old woman; Literary Archive; Dmitri Prokofitch; great
    deal; United States; Praskovya Pavlovna; Porfiry Petrovitch; ear rings

Notice that "Project Gutenberg" appears as a collocation in this text.
Each text downloaded from Project Gutenberg contains a header with the
name of the text, the author, the names of people who scanned and
corrected the text, a license, and so on.  Sometimes this information
appears in a footer at the end of the file.  We cannot reliably detect
where the content begins and ends, and so have to resort to manual
inspection of the file, to discover unique strings that mark the beginning
and the end, before trimming ``raw`` to be just the content and nothing else:

    >>> raw.find("PART I")
    5303
    >>> raw.rfind("End of Project Gutenberg's Crime")
    1157681
    >>> raw = raw[5303:1157681]

The "find" and "reverse find" functions help us get the right index values.
Now the raw text begins with "PART I", and goes up to (but not including) the
phrase that marks the end of the content.

This was our first brush with reality: texts found on the web may contain
unwanted material, and there may not be an automatic way to remove it.
With a small amount of extra work we can extract the material we need.

Dealing with HTML
-----------------

A large amount of text on the web is in the form of |HTML| documents.
You can use a web browser to save a page as text to a local
file, then access this as described in the section on files below.
However, if you're going to do this a lot, its easiest to get Python
to do the work directly.  The first step is the same as before,
using ``urlopen``.  For fun we'll pick a BBC News story
called *Blondes to die out in 200 years*, an urban legend
reported as established scientific fact (as noted on ``languagelog.org``).

    >>> url = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2284783.stm"
    >>> html = urlopen(url).read()
    >>> html[:60]
    '<!doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN'

You can type ``print html`` to see the |HTML| content in all its glory,
including meta tags, an image map, JavaScript, forms, and tables.

Getting text out of |HTML| is a sufficiently common task that |NLTK| provides
a helper function ``nltk.clean_html()``, which takes an |HTML| string and
returns text.

    >>> raw = nltk.clean_html(html)
    >>> tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(raw)
    >>> tokens
    ['BBC', 'NEWS', '|', 'Health', '|', 'Blondes', "'", 'to', 'die', 'out', ...]

This still contains lots of unwanted material concerning site navigation and related
stories.  With some trial and error you can find the start and end indexes of the
content and select the tokens of interest, and initialize a text as before.

    >>> tokens = tokens[96:399]
    >>> text = nltk.Text(tokens)
    >>> text.concordance('gene')
     they say too few people now carry the gene for blondes to last beyond the next tw
    t blonde hair is caused by a recessive gene . In order for a child to have blonde 
    to have blonde hair , it must have the gene on both sides of the family in the gra
    there is a disadvantage of having that gene or by chance . They don ' t disappear 
    ondes would disappear is if having the gene was a disadvantage and I do not think

Reading Local Files
-------------------

.. Monkey-patching to fake the file/web examples in this section:

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> def fake_open(filename, mode=None):
    ...     return StringIO('Time flies like an arrow.\nFruit flies like a banana.\n')
    >>> def fake_urlopen(url):
    ...     return StringIO('<!doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"')
    >>> open = fake_open
    >>> import urllib
    >>> urllib.urlopen = fake_urlopen

.. note:: |TRY|
   Create a file called ``document.txt`` using a text editor, and type in a few lines of text,
   and save it as plain text.
   If you are using |IDLE|, select the *New Window* command in the *File* menu, typing
   the required text into this window, and then saving the file as
   ``document.txt`` inside the directory that |IDLE| offers in the pop-up dialogue box.
   Next, in the Python interpreter, open the file using ``f = open('document.txt')``, then
   inspect its contents using ``print f.read()``.

Various things might have gone wrong when you tried this.
If the interpreter couldn't find your file, you would have seen an
error like this:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> f = open('document.txt')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<pyshell#7>", line 1, in -toplevel-
    f = open('document.txt')
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'document.txt'

To check that the file that you are trying to open is really in the
right directory, use |IDLE|\ 's *Open* command in the *File* menu;
this will display a list of all the files in the directory where
|IDLE| is running. An alternative is to examine the current
directory from within Python:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> import os
    >>> os.listdir('.')

Another possible problem you might have encountered when accessing a text file
is the newline conventions, which are different for different operating systems. 
The built-in ``open()`` function has a second parameter for controlling how
the file is opened: ``open('document.txt', 'rU')`` |mdash|
``'r'`` means to open the file for reading (the default), and
``'U'`` stands for "Universal", which lets us ignore the different
conventions used for marking newlines.

Assuming that you can open the file, there are several methods for reading it.
The ``read()`` method creates a string with the contents of the entire file:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> f.read() 
    'Time flies like an arrow.\nFruit flies like a banana.\n'

Recall that the ``'\n'`` characters are `newlines`:dt:\ ; this
is equivalent to pressing *Enter* on a keyboard and starting a new line. 

We can also read a file one line at a time using a ``for`` loop:

    >>> f = open('document.txt', 'rU')
    >>> for line in f:
    ...     print line.strip()
    Time flies like an arrow.
    Fruit flies like a banana.

Here we use the ``strip()`` function to remove the newline character at the end of
the input line.

It is possible to use the methods described above
with ``nltk.data.find()`` method to access and read NLTK's corpus files
directly:

    >>> file = nltk.data.find('corpora/gutenberg/melville-moby_dick.txt')
    >>> raw = open(file, 'rU').read()

Extracting Text from PDF, MSWord and other Binary Formats
---------------------------------------------------------

ASCII text and |HTML| text are human readable formats.  Text often comes in binary
formats |mdash| like PDF and MSWord |mdash| that can only be opened using specialized
software.  Third-party libraries such as ``pypdf`` and ``pywin32`` can be used to access
these formats [appendix section on this?].  For once-off conversion of a few documents,
it is simpler to open the document with a suitable application, then save it as text
to the local drive, and access it as described below.
If the document is already on the web, you can enter its URL in Google's search box.
The search result often includes a link to an |HTML| version of the document,
which you can save as text.  

Getting User Input
------------------

Another source of text is a user interacting with our program.  We can prompt the user
to type a line of input using ``raw_input()``.  We can save that to a variable and
manipulate it just as we have done for other strings.

    >>> s = raw_input("Enter some text: ")
    Enter some text: On an exceptionally hot evening early in July
    >>> print "You typed", len(nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(s)), "words."
    You typed 8 words.

Summary
-------

Figure pipeline1_ summarizes what we have covered in this section, including the process
of building a vocabulary that we saw in Chapter chap-introduction_.  (One step, normalization,
will be discussed later in this chapter.)

.. _pipeline1:
.. figure:: ../images/pipeline1.png
   :scale: 80

   The Processing Pipeline

There's a lot going on in this pipeline.  To understand it properly, it helps to be
clear about the type of each variable that it mentions.  We find out the type
of any Python object ``x`` using ``type(x)``, e.g. ``type(1)`` is ``<int>``
since ``1`` is an integer.

When we load the contents of a URL or file, and when we strip out HTML markup,
we are dealing with strings, Python's ``<str>`` data type:

    >>> raw = open('document.txt').read()
    >>> type(raw)
    <str>

When we tokenize a string we produce a list (of words), and this is Python's ``<list>``
type.  Normalizing and sorting lists produces other lists:

    >>> tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(raw)
    >>> type(tokens)
    <list> 
    >>> words = [w.lower() for w in tokens]
    >>> type(words)
    <list>
    >>> vocab = sorted(set(words))
    >>> type(vocab)
    <list>

The type of an object determines what operations you can perform on it.
So, for example, we can append to a list but not to a string:

    >>> vocab.append('blog')
    >>> raw.append('blog')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'

Similarly, we can concatenate strings with strings, and lists with
lists, but we cannot concatenate strings with lists:

    >>> query = 'Who knows?'
    >>> beatles = ['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo']
    >>> query + beatles
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects

You may also have noticed that our analogy between operations on
strings and numbers works for multiplication and addition, but not
subtraction or division:

    >>> 'very' * 3 
    'veryveryvery'
    >>> 'very' - 'y'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
    >>> 6 / 2
    3
    >>> 'very' / 2
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'

These error messages are another example of Python telling us that we
have got our data types in a muddle. In the first case, we are told
that the operation of substraction (i.e., ``-``) cannot apply to
objects of type ``str``, while in the second, we are told that
division cannot take ``str`` and ``int`` as its two operands.

.. _sec-strings:

--------------------------------------------
Strings: Text Processing at the Lowest Level
--------------------------------------------

Its time to study a fundamental data type that we've been studiously avoiding
so far.  In earlier chapters we focussed on a text as a list of words.  We didn't
look too closely at words and how they are handled in the programming
language.  By using |NLTK|\ 's corpus interface we were able to ignore
the files that these texts had come from.  The contents of a word, and
of a file, are represented by programming languages as a fundamental
data type known as a `string`:dt:.  In this section we explore strings
in detail, and show the connection between strings, words, texts and files.

Basic Operations with Strings
-----------------------------

    >>> monty = 'Monty Python'
    >>> monty
    'Monty Python'
    >>> circus = 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        circus = 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'
                               ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>> circus = "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
    >>> circus
    "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
     
The ``+`` operation can be used with strings, and is known as `concatenation`:dt:.
It produces a new string that is a copy of the
two original strings pasted together end-to-end.  Notice that
concatenation doesn't do anything clever like insert a space between
the words.  The Python interpreter has no way of knowing that you want
a space; it does `exactly`:em: what it is told.  Given the example
of ``+``, you might be able guess what multiplication will do:

    >>> 'very' + 'very' + 'very'
    'veryveryvery'
    >>> 'very' * 3
    'veryveryvery'

.. Note:: Be careful to distinguish between the string ``' '``, which
   is a single whitespace character, and ``''``, which is the empty string.

Printing Strings
----------------

So far, when we have wanted to look at the contents of a variable or
see the result of a calculation, we have just typed the variable name
into the interpreter.  We can also see the contents of a variable
using the ``print`` statement:

    >>> print monty
    Monty Python

Notice that there are no quotation marks this time.  When we inspect
a variable by typing its name in the interpreter, the interpreter prints
the Python representation of its value.  Since its a string,
the result is quoted.  However, when we tell the
interpreter to print the contents of the variable, we don't see
quotation characters since there are none inside the string.

The ``print`` statement allows us to display more than one item on a line
in various ways, as shown below:

    >>> grail = 'Holy Grail'
    >>> print monty grail
    Monty PythonHoly Grail
    >>> print monty, grail
    Monty Python Holy Grail
    >>> print monty, "and the", grail
    Monty Python and the Holy Grail    
    
Accessing Individual Characters
-------------------------------

As we saw in Section sec-a-closer-look-at-python-texts-as-lists-of-words_ for lists, strings are indexed, starting from zero.
When we index a string, we get one of its characters (or letters):

    >>> monty[0]
    'M'
    >>> monty[3]
    't'
    >>> monty[5]
    ' '

As for lists, if we try to access an index that is outside of the string we get an error:

    >>> monty[20]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    IndexError: string index out of range

As with lists, we can use negative indexes for strings,
where ``-1`` is the index of the last character.
Using positive and negative indexes, we have two ways to refer to
any position in a string.  In this case, when the string had a length of 12,
indexes ``5`` and ``-7`` both refer to the same character (a space), and:
``5 = len(monty) - 7``.

    >>> monty[-1]
    'n'
    >>> monty[-7]
    ' '

We can write ``for`` loops to iterate over the characters
in strings.  This ``print`` statement ends with a trailing comma, which is
how we tell Python not to print a newline at the end.

    >>> sent = 'colorless green ideas sleep furiously'
    >>> for char in sent:
    ...     print char,
    ... 
    c o l o r l e s s   g r e e n   i d e a s   s l e e p   f u r i o u s l y

We can count individual characters as well.  We should ignore the case
distinction by normalizing everything to lowercase, and filter out non-alphabetic characters:

    >>> raw = gutenberg.raw('melville-moby_dick.txt')
    >>> fdist = FreqDist(ch.lower() for ch in raw if ch.isalpha())
    >>> fdist.keys()
    ['e', 't', 'a', 'o', 'n', 'i', 's', 'h', 'r', 'l', 'd', 'u', 'm', 'c', 'w',
    'f', 'g', 'p', 'b', 'y', 'v', 'k', 'q', 'j', 'x', 'z']

This gives us the letters of the alphabet, with the most frequently occurring letters
listed first (this is quite complicated and we'll explain it more carefully below).
You might like to visualize the distribution using ``fdist.plot()``.
The relative character frequencies of a text can be used in automatically identifying
the language of the text.

Accessing Substrings
--------------------

A substring is any continuous section of a string that we want to pull out for
further processing.  We can easily access substrings using the same slice notation
we used for lists.
For example, the following code accesses the substring starting at index ``6``,
up to (but not including) index ``10``:

    >>> monty[6:10]
    'Pyth'

Here we see the characters are ``'P'``, ``'y'``, ``'t'``, and ``'h'`` which correspond
to ``monty[6]`` ... ``monty[9]`` but not ``monty[10]``. This is because
a slice `starts`:em: at the first index but finishes `one before`:em: the end index.

We can also slice with negative indices |mdash| the same basic rule of starting
from the start index and stopping one before the end index applies;
here we stop before the space character.

    >>> monty[0:-7]
    'Monty'

As with list slices, if we omit the first value, the substring begins at the start
of the string.  If we omit the second value, the substring continues to the end
of the string: 

    >>> monty[:5]
    'Monty'
    >>> monty[6:]
    'Python'

We can also find the position of a substring within a string, using ``find()``:

    >>> monty.find('Python')
    6

Analyzing Strings
-----------------

* character frequency plot, e.g get text in some language using ``language_x = nltk.corpus.udhr.raw(x)``,
  then construct its frequency distribution ``fdist = FreqDist(language_x)``, then
  view the distribution with ``fdist.keys()`` and ``fdist.plot()``.

* functions involving strings, e.g. determining past tense

* built-ins, ``find()``, ``rfind()``, ``index()``, ``rindex()``

* revisit string tests like ``endswith()`` from chapter 1

The Difference between Lists and Strings
----------------------------------------

Strings and lists are both kind of `sequence`:dt:.  We can pull them
apart by indexing and slicing them, and we can join them together
by concatenating them.  However, we cannot join strings and lists:

    >>> query = 'Who knows?'
    >>> beatles = ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']
    >>> query[2]
    'o'
    >>> beatles[2]
    'George'
    >>> query[:2]
    'Wh'
    >>> beatles[:2]
    ['John', 'Paul']
    >>> query + " I don't"
    "Who knows? I don't"
    >>> beatles + 'Brian'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "str") to list
    >>> beatles + ['Brian']
    ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo', 'Brian']

When we open a file
for reading into a Python program, we get a string
corresponding to the contents of the whole file. If we to use a ``for`` loop to
process the elements of this string, all we can pick out are the
individual characters |mdash| we don't get to choose the
granularity. By contrast, the elements of a list can be as big or
small as we like: for example, they could be paragraphs, sentence,
phrases, words, characters. So lists have the advantage that we
can be flexible about the elements they contain, and
correspondingly flexible about any downstream processing.
So one of the first things we are likely to do in a piece of |NLP|
code is tokenize a string into a list of strings (Section sec-tokenization_).
Conversely, when we want to write our results to a file, or to a terminal,
we will usually format them as a string (Section sec-formatting_).

Lists and strings do not have exactly the same functionality.
Lists have the added power that you can change their elements:

    >>> beatles[0] = "John Lennon"
    >>> del beatles[-1]
    >>> beatles
    ['John Lennon', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']

On the other hand if we try to do that with a *string*
|mdash| changing the 0th character in ``query`` to ``'F'`` |mdash| we get:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> query[0] = 'F'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    TypeError: object does not support item assignment

|nopar| This is because strings are `immutable`:dt: |mdash| you can't change a
string once you have created it.  However, lists are `mutable`:dt:,
and their contents can be modified at any time.  As a result, lists
support operations that modify the original value rather than producing a new value.

.. _sec-regular-expressions:

------------------------------------
Regular Expressions 1: Word Patterns
------------------------------------

Many linguistic processing tasks involve pattern matching.
For example, we can find words ending with `ed`:lx: using
``endswith('ed')``.  We saw a variety of such "word tests"
in Figure word-tests_.
Regular expressions give us a more powerful and flexible
method for describing the character patterns we are interested in.

.. note::
   There are many other published introductions to regular expressions,
   organized around the syntax of regular expressions and applied to searching
   text files.  Instead, we will focus on the use of regular expressions
   at different stages of linguistic processing.  As usual, we'll adopt
   a problem-based approach and present new features only as they are
   needed to solve practical problems.  In our discussion we will mark
   regular expressions using chevrons like this: |patt|\ .

To use regular expressions in Python we need to import the "re" library using: ``import re``.
We also need a list of words to search; we'll use the words corpus again (Section sec-lexical-resources_).
We will preprocess it to remove any proper names.

    >>> import re
    >>> wordlist = [w for w in nltk.corpus.words.words() if w.islower()]

Using Basic Meta-Characters
---------------------------

Let's find words ending with `ed`:lx: using the regular expression |l|\ ``ed$``\ |r|.
We need to specify the characters of interest, and use the dollar sign which has a
special behavior in the context of regular expressions in that it matches
the end of the word:

    >>> [w for w in wordlist if re.search('ed$', w)]
    ['abaissed', 'abandoned', 'abased', 'abashed', 'abatised', 'abed', 'aborted', ...]

The "``.``" `wildcard`:dt: symbol matches any single character.
Suppose we have room in a crossword puzzle for an 8-letter word
with `j`:lx: as its third letter and `t`:lx: as its sixth letter.
In place of each blank cell we use a period:

    >>> [w for w in wordlist if re.search('^..j..t..$', w)]
    ['abjectly', 'adjuster', 'dejected', 'dejectly', 'injector', 'majestic', ...]

.. note:: |TRY|
   The caret symbol ``^`` matches the start of the word, just like the ``$`` matches
   the end of the word.  What results to we get with the above example if we leave out
   both of these, and search for |l|\ ``..j..t..``\ |r|?

Finally, the "``?``" symbol specifies that the previous character is optional.
Thus |l|\ ``e-?mail``\ |r| will match both `email`:lx: and `e-mail`:lx:.
We could count the total number of occurrences of this word (in either spelling)
using ``len(w for w in text if re.search('e-?mail', w))``.

Ranges and Closures
-------------------

.. _T9:
.. figure:: ../images/T9.png
   :scale: 20

   T9: Text on 9 Keys

The `T9`:dt: system is used for entering text on mobile phones.  Two or more words that
are entered using the same sequence of keystrokes are known as `textonyms`:dt:.
For example, both `hole`:lx: and `golf`:lx: are entered using 4653.  What other words
could be produced with the same sequence?  Here we use the regular expression
|l|\ ``^[ghi][mno][jlk][def]$``\ |r|:
 
    >>> [w for w in wordlist if re.search('^[ghi][mno][jlk][def]$', w)]
    ['gold', 'golf', 'hold', 'hole', 'gold', 'hole']

The first part of the expression, |l|\ ``^[ghi]``\ |r|, matches the start of
a word followed by `g`:lx:, `h`:lx:, or `i`:lx:.  The next part of the expression,
|l|\ ``[mno]``\ |r|, constrains the second character to be
`m`:lx:, `n`:lx:, or `o`:lx:.  The third and fourth characters are also constrained.
Only six words satisfy all these constraints.
Note that the order of characters inside the square brackets is not significant, so we
could have written |l|\ ``^[hig][nom][ljk][fed]$``\ |r| and matched the same
words.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Look for some "finger-twisters", by searching for words that only use part
   of the number-pad.  For example |l|\ ``^[g-o]+$``\ |r| will match words
   that only use keys 4, 5, 6 in the center row, and |l|\ ``^[a-fj-o]+$``\ |r|
   will match words that use keys 2, 3, 5, 6 in the top-right corner.
   What do "``-``" and "``+``" mean?

Let's explore the "``+``" symbol a bit further.  Notice that it can be applied to
individual letters, or to bracketed sets of letters:

    >>> chat_words = sorted(set(w for w in nltk.corpus.nps_chat.words()))
    >>> [w for w in chat_words if re.search('^m+i+n+e+$', w)]
    ['miiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeee', 'miiiiiinnnnnnnnnneeeeeeee', 'mine',
    'mmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnneeeeeeee']
    >>> [w for w in chat_words if re.search('^[ha]+$', w)]
    ['a', 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'aaahhhh', 'ah', 'ahah', 'ahahah', 'ahh',
    'ahhahahaha', 'ahhh', 'ahhhh', 'ahhhhhh', 'ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh', 'h', 'ha', 'haaa',
    'hah', 'haha', 'hahaaa', 'hahah', 'hahaha', 'hahahaa', 'hahahah', 'hahahaha', ...]

It should be clear that "``+``" simply means "one or more instances of the preceding item",
which could be an individual character like ``m``, a set like ``[fed]`` or a range like ``[d-f]``.
Now let's replace "``+``" with "``*``" which means "zero or more instances of the preceding item".
The regular expression |l|\ ``^m*i*n*e*$``\ |r| will match everything that we found using
|l|\ ``^m+i+n+e+$``\ |r|, but also words where some of the letters don't appear at all,
e.g. `me`:lx:, `min`:lx:, and `mmmmm`:lx:.

The "``^``" operator has another function when it appears inside square brackets.  For
example |l|\ ``[^aeiouAEIOU]``\ |r| matches any character other than a vowel.
We can search the Chat corpus for words that are made up entirely of non-vowel
characters using |l|\ ``^[^aeiouAEIOU]+$``\ |r| to find items like these:
``:):):)``, ``grrr``, ``cyb3r`` and ``zzzzzzzz``.  Notice this includes non-alphabetic
characters.

.. note:: |TRY|
   Study the following examples and work out what the ``\``, ``{}`` and ``(..|..)`` notations mean:

      >>> wsj = sorted(set(nltk.corpus.treebank.words()))
      >>> [w for w in wsj if re.search('^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$', w)]
      ['0.0085', '0.05', '0.1', '0.16', '0.2', '0.25', '0.28', '0.3', '0.4', '0.5',

      '1.01', '1.1', '1.125', '1.14', '1.1650', '1.17', '1.18', '1.19', '1.2', ...]
      >>> [w for w in wsj if re.search('^[A-Z]+\$$', w)]
      ['C$', 'US$']
      >>> [w for w in wsj if re.search('^[0-9]{4}$', w)]
      ['1614', '1637', '1787', '1901', '1903', '1917', '1925', '1929', '1933', ...]
      >>> [w for w in wsj if re.search('^[0-9]+-[a-z]{3,5}$', w)]
      ['10-day', '10-lap', '10-year', '100-share', '12-point', '12-year', ...]
      >>> [w for w in wsj if re.search('^[a-z]{5,}-[a-z]{2,3}-[a-z]{,6}$', w)]
      ['black-and-white', 'bread-and-butter', 'father-in-law', 'machine-gun-toting',
      'savings-and-loan']
      >>> EXAMPLE WITH (  |  |  )

You probably worked out that a backslash means that the following character is
deprived of its special powers and must literally match a specific character in the
word.  Thus, while "``.``" is special, "``\.``" only matches a period.
The brace characters are used to specify the number of repeats of the previous item.

The meta-characters we have seen are summarized in Table regexp-meta-characters1_.

   Basic Regular Expression Meta-Characters, Including Wildcards, Ranges and Closures

Extracting Parts of Words With Regular Expressions
--------------------------------------------------

The above examples all involved searching for words `w`:math:
that match some regular expression `regexp`:lx: using ``re.search(regexp, w)``.
Apart from checking if a regular expression matches a word, we can use a
regular expression to extract material from a word.

The "find all" method finds all (non-overlapping) matches of the given
regular expression.  Let's find all the vowels in a word, then count them:

    >>> word = 'supercalifragulisticexpialidocious'
    >>> re.findall('[aeiou]', word)
    ['u', 'e', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'u', 'i', 'i', 'e', 'i', 'a', 'i', 'o', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    >>> len(re.findall('[aeiou]', word))
    16

Let's look for all sequences of two or more vowels in some text,
and determine their relative frequency:

    >>> wsj = sorted(set(nltk.corpus.treebank.words()))
    >>> fd = nltk.FreqDist(vs for word in wsj
    ...                       for vs in re.findall('[aeiou]{2,}', word))
    >>> fd.items()
    [('io', 549), ('ea', 476), ('ie', 331), ('ou', 329), ('ai', 261), ('ia', 253),
    ('ee', 217), ('oo', 174), ('ua', 109), ('au', 106), ('ue', 105), ('ui', 95),
    ('ei', 86), ('oi', 65), ('oa', 59), ('eo', 39), ('iou', 27), ('eu', 18), ...]

.. note:: |TRY|
   In the W3C Date Time Format, dates are represented like this: 2009-12-31.
   Replace the ``?`` in the following Python code with a regular expression,
   in order to convert the string ``'2009-12-31'`` to a list of integers
   ``[2009, 12, 31]``.

   ``[int(n) for n in re.findall(?, '2009-12-31')]``

It is sometimes noted that English text is highly redundant, and it is still
easy to read when word-internal vowels are left out.  For example,
`declaration`:lx: becomes `dclrtn`:lx:, and `inalienable`:lx: becomes `inlnble`:lx:
(retaining peripheral vowels): 

    >>> regexp = '^[AEIOUaeiou]+|[^AEIOUaeiou]|[AEIOUaeiou]+$'
    >>> def compress(word):
    ...     return ''.join(re.findall(regexp, word))
    ...
    >>> english_udhr = nltk.corpus.udhr.words('English-Latin1')
    >>> print nltk.tokenwrap(compress(w) for w in english_udhr[:75])

    and the advnt of a wrld in whch hmn bngs shll enjy frdm of spch and

Finally, let's combine regular expressions with conditional frequency
distributions.  Here we will extract all consonant-vowel sequences
from the words of Rotokas, such as `ka`:lx: and `si`:lx:.  Since each of
these is a pair, it can be used to initialize a conditional frequency
distribution.  We then tabulate the frequency of each pair:

    >>> rotokas_words = nltk.corpus.toolbox.words('rotokas.dic')
    >>> cvs = [cv for w in rotokas_words for cv in re.findall('[ptksvr][aeiou]', w)]
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(cvs)
    >>> cfd.tabulate()
         a    e    i    o    u
    k  418  148   94  420  173
    p   83   31  105   34   51
    r  187   63   84   89   79
    s    0    0  100    2    1
    t   47    8    0  148   37
    v   93   27  105   48   49

Examining the rows for `s`:lx: and `t`:lx:, we see they are in "complementary
distribution", which is evidence that they are not distinct phonemes in the language.
Thus, we could conceivably drop `s`:lx: from the Rotokas alphabet and simply
have a pronunciation rule that the letter `t`:lx: is pronounced `s`:lx: when followed by `i`:lx:.

.. note::
   You need to take care when using grouping parentheses inside a regular expression.
   Some functions including ``re.findall()`` interpret the parentheses as selecting
   material to be returned in the result.  If you need to tell ``re.findall()`` not
   to do anything special with these parentheses, add ``?:``, e.g.
   |l|\ ``(?:ed|ing|s)``\ |r|.


.. _sec-tokenization:

-----------------------------------
Regular Expressions 2: Tokenization
-----------------------------------

If we ask how many words there are in ``sentence``, we get
different answers depending on whether we count duplicates. 
Clearly we are using different senses of "word" here.



Consider the following code, which splits a string into a list of words: 

    >>> sentence = "This is the time -- and this is the record of the time."
    >>> words = sentence.split()
    >>> words
    ['This', 'is', 'the', 'time', '--', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'record', 'of', 'the', 'time.']
    >>> len(words)
    13
    >>> len(set(words))
    10



A word `token`:dt: is an individual occurrence
of a word in a concrete context; it exists in time and space.  A word
`type`:dt: is a more abstract; it's what we're talking about when we
say that the three occurrences of ``the`` in ``sentence`` are  "the same word."
As it happens, Python can tell us if two strings are the same token or not:

    >>> words[2]
    'the'
    >>> words[2] == words[8]
    True
    >>> words[2] is words[8]
    False
    >>> words[2] is words[2]
    True

The operator ``==`` tests whether two expressions are equal, and in
this case, it is testing for string-identity. This is the notion of
identity that was assumed by our use of ``set()`` above. By contrast, the
``is`` operator tests whether two objects are stored in the same
location of memory, and is therefore analogous to token-identity.  
When we used ``split()`` to turn a string into a list of words,
our tokenization method was to say that any strings that
are delimited by whitespace count as a word token. But this simple
approach doesn't always give the desired results.
Also, testing string-identity isn't a very useful criterion for
assigning tokens to types. We therefore need to address two questions
in more detail:
*Tokenization:* Which substrings of the original text should be treated as word tokens?
*Type definition:* How do we decide whether two tokens have the same type?

To see the problems with our first stab at defining tokens and types
in ``sentence``, let's look at the actual tokens we found:

    >>> set(words)
    set(['and', 'this', 'record', 'This', 'of', 'is', '--', 'time.', 'time', 'the'])

|nopar|
Observe that ``'time'`` and ``'time.'`` are incorrectly
treated as distinct types since the trailing period
has been bundled with the rest of the word.
Although ``'--'`` is some kind of token, it's not a `word`:em: token.
Additionally, ``'This'`` and ``'this'`` are incorrectly distinguished
from each other, because of a difference in capitalization that should
be ignored.

If we turn to languages other than English, tokenizing text is even more
challenging.  In Chinese text there is no visual representation of word
boundaries.  Consider the following
three-character string: |ai4|\ |guo3|\ |ren2| (in pinyin plus tones:
ai4 "love" (verb), guo3 "country", ren2 "person"). This could
either be segmented as [|ai4|\ |guo3|]\ |ren2|\ ,
"country-loving person" or as |ai4|\ [|guo3|\ |ren2|]\ ,
"love country-person."

To summarize, we cannot just say that two word tokens have the same type if they are
the same string of characters.  We need to
consider a variety of factors in determining what counts as
the same word, and we need to be careful in how we
identify tokens in the first place.



Tokenization with Regular Expressions
-------------------------------------

Tokenization is the task of cutting a string into
identifiable linguistic units that constitute a piece of language data. In our first attempt to
carry out this task, we started off with a string of characters, and
used the ``split()`` method to break the string at whitespace
characters (including tabs and newlines).
In this section we will take a more sophisticated approach, using
regular expressions to specify which character sequences should be
treated as words.

Let's begin by splitting the string on whitespace (this includes tabs and newline)

    >>> re.split(r'\s', sentence)
    ['This', 'is', 'the', 'time', '--', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'record', 'of', 'the', 'time.']

[need a better example of tokenization problems, including "don't".

The above method includes sentence-ending punctuation with a word...  What happens when we use the
'\W' operator to consume these?

    >>> re.split(r'\W', sentence)
    ['This', 'is', 'the', 'time', '', '', '', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'record', 'of', 'the', 'time', '']

Also gives us empty strings (explain why).

    >>> re.findall('\w+', sentence)
    ['This', 'is', 'the', 'time', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'record', 'of', 'the', 'time']
    >>> re.findall('\w+|\S+', sentence)
    ['This', 'is', 'the', 'time', '--', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'record', 'of', 'the', 'time', '.']

   Regular Expression Symbols



.. Note:: This example uses a Python `raw string`:dt:\:
   ``r'\b\w\w\w\b'``. The specific justification here is that in an
   ordinary string, ``\b`` is interpreted as a backspace character.
   Python will convert it to a backspace in a regular expression
   unless you use the ``r`` prefix to create a raw string as shown
   above. Another use for raw strings is to match strings that
   include backslashes. Suppose we want to match 'either\\or'. In order
   to create a regular expression, the backslash needs to be escaped,
   since it is a special character; 
   so we want to pass the pattern ``\\`` to the regular expression
   interpreter. But to express this as a Python string literal, each
   backslash must be escaped again, yielding the string
   ``'\\\\'``. However, with a raw string, this reduces down to
   ``r'\\'``. 



NLTK's Regular Expression Tokenizer
-----------------------------------

Tokenization based solely on whitespace is too simplistic for most applications...


The function ``nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize()`` takes a text string and a
regular expression, and returns the list of substrings that match the
regular expression.  To define a tokenizer that includes punctuation
as separate tokens, we could do the following:

    >>> text = '''Hello.  Isn't this fun?'''
    >>> pattern = r'\w+|[^\w\s]+'
    >>> nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize(text, pattern)
    ['Hello', '.', 'Isn', "'", 't', 'this', 'fun', '?']

|nopar| 
The regular expression in this example will match a sequence
consisting of one or more word characters ``\w+``.  It will also match
a sequence consisting of one or more punctuation characters (or
non-word, non-space characters ``[^\w\s]+``).  This is another negated range
expression; it matches one or more characters that are not word
characters (i.e., not a match for ``\w``) and not a whitespace
character (i.e., not a match for ``\s``).  We use the disjunction
operator ``|`` to combine these into a single complex expression
``\w+|[^\w\s]+``.

There are a number of ways we could improve on this regular
expression.  For example, it currently breaks `$22.50`:lx: into four
tokens; we might want it to treat this as a single token.
Similarly, `U.S.A.` should count as a single token.  We can
deal with these by adding further cases to the regular
expression.  For readability we will break it up and insert comments, and
insert the special ``(?x)`` "verbose flag" so that Python knows
to strip out the embedded whitespace and comments.

    >>> text = 'That poster costs $22.40.'
    >>> pattern = r'''(?x)
    ...     \w+               # sequences of 'word' characters
    ...   | \$?\d+(\.\d+)?    # currency amounts, e.g. $12.50
    ...   | ([A-Z]\.)+        # abbreviations, e.g. U.S.A.
    ...   | [^\w\s]+          # sequences of punctuation
    ... '''
    >>> nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize(text, pattern)
    ['That', 'poster', 'costs', '$22.40', '.']

It is sometimes more convenient to write a regular expression
matching the material that appears *between* tokens, such as whitespace
and punctuation.  The ``nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize()`` function permits
an optional boolean parameter ``gaps``; when set to ``True`` the
pattern is matched against the gaps.  For example, we could define
a whitespace tokenizer as follows:

    >>> nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize(text, pattern=r'\s+', gaps=True)
    ['That', 'poster', 'costs', '$22.40.']

It is more convenient to call |NLTK|\ 's whitespace
tokenizer directly, as ``nltk.WhitespaceTokenizer(text)``.
(However, in this case is generally better to use Python's ``split()``
method, defined on strings: ``text.split()``.)

--


We can see exactly where a regular expression matches against a string
using NLTK's ``re_show`` function.  Readers are encouraged to use
``re_show`` to explore the behavior of regular expressions.

    >>> string = """
    ... It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets
    ... that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, ...
    ... """
    >>> nltk.re_show('t...', string)
    I{t's }probably wor{th p}aying a premium for funds {that} inves{t in} markets
    {that} are par{tial}ly closed {to f}oreign inves{tors}, such as Sou{th K}orea, ...




Spanning a Line Break
---------------------

Occasionally we need to match material that spans a line-break.  For
example, we may want to strip out the HTML markup from a document.
To do this we must delete material between angle brackets.
The most obvious expression is: |<.*>|.  However, this has two
problems: it will not match an HTML tag that contains a line-break,
and the |.*| will consume as much material as possible (including the
``>`` character).  To permit matching over a line-break we must use
Python's ``DOTALL`` flag, and to ensure that the ``>`` matches
against the first instance of the character we must do non-greedy
matching using ``*?``:

    >>> text = """one two three <font
    ...           color="red">four</font> five"""
    >>> re.sub(r'<.*?>', ' ', text, re.DOTALL)

Practice Makes Perfect
----------------------

Regular expressions are very flexible and very powerful. However, they
often don't do what you expect. For this reason, you are strongly
encouraged to try out a variety of tasks using ``re_show()`` and
``re.findall()`` in order to develop your intuitions further; the
exercises below should help get you started.  We suggest that you build up a
regular expression in small pieces, rather than trying to get it
completely right first time.



Stripping HTML with Regular Expressions
---------------------------------------

Web pages are usually in |HTML| format.  To extract the text, we
need to strip out the |HTML| markup, i.e. remove all material enclosed in
angle brackets. Let's digress briefly to consider how to carry out
this task using regular expressions. Our first attempt might look as
follows:

    >>> line = '<title>BBC NEWS | News Front Page</title>'
    >>> new = re.sub(r'<.*>', '', line)

So the regular expression ``'<.*>'`` is intended to match a
pair of left and right angle brackets, with a string of any characters
intervening. However, look at what the result is:

    >>> new
    '' 

|nopar| 
What has happened here? The problem is twofold. First,
the wildcard ``'.'`` matches any character other than ``'\n'``,
so it will match ``'>'`` and ``'<'``.
Second, the ``'*'`` operator is "greedy", in the sense that it matches
as many characters as it can. In the above example,
``'.*'`` will return not the shortest match, namely
``'title'``, but the longest match, ``'title>BBC NEWS | News Front
Page</title'``.   To get the *shortest* match we have to use the ``'*?'`` operator.
We will also normalize whitespace, replacing any sequence
of spaces, tabs or newlines (``'\s+'``) with a single space character.

    >>> page = re.sub('<.*?>', '', page)
    >>> page = re.sub('\s+', ' ', page)
    >>> print page[:60]
     BBC NEWS | News Front Page News Sport Weather World Service

.. Note:: Note that your output for the above code may differ from ours,
   because the BBC home page may have been changed since this
   example was created.

.. TODO: fix above example?  (make it current; issue with script on BBC site)

You will probably find it useful to borrow the structure of the above code
snippet for future tasks involving regular expressions: each time
through a series of substitutions, the result of operating on ``page``
gets assigned as the new value of ``page``. This approach allows us to
decompose the transformations we need into a series of simple regular
expression substitutions, each of which can be tested and debugged on its own.



As another example, suppose we want to match any string which is
enclosed by the HTML tags for boldface, namely ``<B>`` and ``</B>``.
We might try something like this: |<B>.*</B>|\ . This would
successfully match ``<B>important</B>``, but would also match
``<B>important</B> and <B>urgent</B>``, since the |.*| sub-pattern will
happily match all the characters from the end of ``important`` to the
end of ``urgent``. One way of ensuring that we only look at matched
pairs of tags would be to use the expression |l|\ ``<B>[^<]*</B>``\
|r|\ , where the character class matches anything other than a left
angle bracket.


In the section on complementation, we briefly looked at the task of
matching strings which were enclosed by HTML markup. Our first attempt
is illustrated in the following code example, where we incorrectly
match the whole string, rather than just the substring
"``<B>important</B>``".

  >>> html = '<B>important</B> and <B>urgent</B>'
  >>> r2 = re.compile('<B>.*</B>')
  >>> print r2.findall(html)
  ['<B>important</B> and <B>urgent</B>']

As we pointed out, one solution is to use a character class which
matches with the complement of "``<``":

  >>> r4 = re.compile('<B>[^<]*</B>')
  >>> print r4.findall(html)
  ['<B>important</B>', '<B>urgent</B>']

However, there is another way of approaching this problem.
|<B>.*</B>| gets the wrong results because the
|*| operator tries to consume as much input as
possible. That is, the matching is said to be *greedy*. In the current
case, |*| matches everything after the first
``<B>``, including the following ``</B>`` and ``<B>``.  If we instead
use the non-greedy star operator |*?|\ , we get the
desired match, since |*?| tries to consume as little input as possible.


More general question of appropriateness of using regular expressions to manipulate HTML or XML markup.



-------------------------------
Lemmatization and Normalization
-------------------------------

Earlier we talked about counting word tokens, and completely ignored
the rest of the sentence in which these tokens appeared.  Thus, for an
example like `I saw the saw`:lx:, we would have treated both `saw`:lx:
tokens as instances of the same type.  However, one is a form of the
verb `see`:lx:, and the other is the name of a cutting instrument.
How do we know that these two forms of `saw`:lx: are unrelated?  One
answer is that as speakers of English, we know that these would appear
as different entries in a dictionary. Another, more empiricist, answer
is that if we looked at a large enough number of texts, it would
become clear that the two forms have very different distributions. For
example, only the noun `saw`:lx: will occur immediately after
determiners such as `the`:lx:.  Distinct words that have the same
written form are called `homographs`:dt:. We can distinguish
homographs with the help of context; often the previous word suffices.
We will explore this idea of context briefly, before addressing the
main topic of this section.

As a first approximation to discovering the distribution of a word, we
can look at all the bigrams it occurs in.
A `bigram`:dt: is simply a pair of words.
For example, in the sentence `She sells sea shells by the sea shore`:lx:,
the bigrams are
`She sells`:lx:,
`sells sea`:lx:,
`sea shells`:lx:,
`shells by`:lx:,
`by the`:lx:,
`the sea`:lx:,
`sea shore`:lx:.

You will also see that this list includes different grammatical forms
of the same verb. We can form separate groups consisting of
`appear`:lx: |tilde| `appears`:lx: |tilde| `appeared`:lx:; `call`:lx:
|tilde| `called`:lx:; `do`:lx: |tilde| `did`:lx:; and `been`:lx:
|tilde| `were`:lx: |tilde| `are`:lx: |tilde| `is`:lx:.  It is common
in linguistics to say that two forms such as `appear`:lx: and
`appeared`:lx: belong to a more abstract notion of a word called a
`lexeme`:dt:; by contrast, `appeared`:lx: and `called`:lx: belong to
different lexemes. You can think of a lexeme as corresponding to an
entry in a dictionary, and a `lemma`:dt: as the headword for that entry.
By convention, small capitals are used when referring to a lexeme or lemma: `appear`:lex:.

Although `appeared`:lx: and `called`:lx: belong to different lexemes,
they do have something in common: they are both past tense forms. This
is signaled by the segment `-ed`:lx:, which we call a morphological
`suffix`:dt:. We also say that such morphologically complex forms are
`inflected`:dt:.  If we strip off the suffix, we get something called
the `stem`:dt:, namely `appear`:lx: and `call`:lx: respectively. While
`appeared`:lx:, `appears`:lx: and `appearing`:lx: are all
morphologically inflected, `appear`:lx: lacks any morphological
inflection and is therefore termed the `base`:dt: form. In English,
the base form is conventionally used as the `lemma`:dt: for a word.

Our notion of context would be more compact if we could group
different forms of the various verbs into their lemmas; then we could
study which verb lexemes are typically modified by a particular
adverb. `Lemmatization`:dt: |mdash| the process of mapping words
to their lemmas |mdash| would yield the
following picture of the distribution of `often`:lx:.
Here, the counts for `often appear`:lx: (3),
`often appeared`:lx: (2) and `often appears`:lx: (1)
are combined into a single line.

::

    often ,     16
    often a     10
    often be        13
    often in        8
    often than      7
    often the       7
    often do        7
    often appear    6
    often call      5

Lemmatization is a rather sophisticated process that uses rules
for the regular word patterns, and table look-up for
the irregular patterns. Within |NLTK|, we can use off-the-shelf
stemmers, such as the `Porter Stemmer`:dt:, the `Lancaster Stemmer`:dt:,
and the stemmer that comes with WordNet, e.g.:

    >>> stemmer = nltk.PorterStemmer()
    >>> verbs = ['appears', 'appear', 'appeared', 'calling', 'called']
    >>> stems = [stemmer.stem(verb) for verb in verbs]
    >>> sorted(set(stems))
    ['appear', 'call']

Stemmers for other languages are added to NLTK as they are contributed,
e.g. the RSLP Portuguese Stemmer, ``nltk.RSLPStemmer()``.

Lemmatization and stemming are special cases of `normalization`:dt:.
They identify a canonical representative for a set of related word forms.
Normalization collapses distinctions.  Exactly how we normalize words depends
on the application.  Often, we convert everything into lower
case so that we can ignore the written distinction between sentence-initial
words and the rest of the words in the sentence.
The Python string method ``lower()`` will accomplish this for us:

    >>> str = 'This is the time'
    >>> str.lower()
    'this is the time'

.. We need to be careful, however; case normalization will also collapse the `New`:lx:
   of `New York`:lx: with the `new`:lx: of `my new car`:lx:.
   [SB: this mixes the issue with named entity detection, and should probably
   be left to the engineering chapter]

A final issue for normalization is the presence of contractions, such
as `didn't`:lx:.  If we are analyzing the meaning
of a sentence, it would probably be more useful to normalize this
form to two separate forms: `did`:lx: and `n't`:lx: (or `not`:lx:).

String Similarity
-----------------

* spelling correction (a kind of normalization)
* stemming (``nltk.stem``)
* Soundex -- indexing strings in a dictionary (key = soundex code; value = list of words)
* anagrams -- key = sorted letters of word; value = list of words with these letters

Semantic Similarity
-------------------

.. TODO: discuss WSD, mention Semcor, give pine cone example

.. It is often useful to be able to tell whether two lexical concepts are
   `semantically related`:dt:. For example, in order to check whether a
   particular instance of the word `bank`:lx: means
   *financial institution*, we can count the number of nearby words
   that are semantically related to this sense.  Using WordNet, we can
   investigate whether semantic relatedness can be
   expressed in terms of the graph structure of the concept hierarchy. 

We would expect that the semantic similarity of two concepts
would correlate with the length of the path between them in WordNet.
The ``wordnet`` package includes a variety of measures
that incorporate this basic insight.  For example,
``path_similarity`` assigns a score in the range ``0``\ |ndash|\
``1``, based on the shortest path that connects the concepts in the hypernym
hierarchy (``-1`` is returned in those cases where a path cannot be
found).  A score of 1 represents identity, i.e., comparing a sense with
itself will return ``1``.

    >>> wordnet.N['poodle'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.N['dalmatian'][1])
    0.33333333333333331
    >>> wordnet.N['dog'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.N['cat'][0])
    0.20000000000000001
    >>> wordnet.V['run'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.V['walk'][0])
    0.25
    >>> wordnet.V['run'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.V['think'][0])
    -1

Several other similarity measures are provided in ``wordnet``:
Leacock-Chodorow, Wu-Palmer, Resnik, Jiang-Conrath, and Lin.
For a detailed comparison of various measures, see [Budanitsky2006EWB]_.

Indexing Texts
--------------

(Discussion of the use of normalization in indexing a text collection; better concordancing)

.. soundex concordancing, wordnet concordancing


---------------------
Sentence Segmentation
---------------------

Manipulating texts at the level of individual words often presupposes
the ability to divide a text into individual sentences.  As we have
seen, some corpora already provide access at the sentence level.  In
the following example, we compute the average number of words per
sentence in the Brown Corpus:

    >>> len(nltk.corpus.brown.words()) / len(nltk.corpus.brown.sents())
    20

In other cases, the text is only available as a stream of characters.  Before
doing word tokenization, we need to do sentence segmentation.  NLTK facilitates
this by including the Punkt sentence segmenter [KissStrunk2006]_, along with
supporting data for English.  Here is an example of its use in segmenting
the text of a novel:

    >>> sent_tokenizer=nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')
    >>> text = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw('chesterton-thursday.txt')
    >>> sents = sent_tokenizer.tokenize(text)
    >>> pprint(sents[171:181])
    ['"Nonsense!',
     '" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else\nattempted paradox.',
     '"Why do all the clerks and navvies in the\nrailway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired?',
     'I will\ntell you.',
     'It is because they know that the train is going right.',
     'It\nis because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket\nfor that place they will reach.',
     'It is because after they have\npassed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be\nVictoria, and nothing but Victoria.',
     'Oh, their wild rapture!',
     'oh,\ntheir eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next\nstation were unaccountably Baker Street!'
     '"\n\n"It is you who are unpoetical," replied the poet Syme.']

Notice that this example is really a single sentence, reporting the speech of Mr Lucian Gregory.
However, the quoted speech contains several sentences, and these have been split into individual
strings.  This is reasonable behavior for most applications.



.. _sec-formatting:

---------------------------------
Formatting: From Lists to Strings
---------------------------------

Converting Between Strings and Lists
------------------------------------

... use the ``join()`` method...

``join()`` only works on a list of strings (what we have been calling a text).
(Thus we could say this type is privileged in Python.)

We specify the string to be used as the "glue", followed by a
period, followed by the ``join()`` function.

    >>> ' '.join(chomsky)
    'colorless green ideas sleep furiously'
    >>> ';'.join(chomsky)
    'colorless;green;ideas;sleep;furiously'

So ``' '.join(chomsky)`` means: take all the items in ``chomsky`` and
concatenate them as one big string, using ``' '`` as a spacer between
the items. 

To be honest, many people find the notation for ``join()`` rather
unintuitive. 

.. Note::
   Move Elsewhere:
   We will see other examples of statements with ``import`` later in this
   chapter.  In general, we use ``import`` statements when we want to get
   access to Python code that doesn't already come as part of core
   Python. This code will exist somewhere as one or more files. Each such
   file corresponds to a Python `module`:dt: |mdash| this is a way of
   grouping together code and data that we regard as reusable. When you
   write down some Python statements in a file, you are in effect
   creating a new Python module. And you can make your code depend on
   another module by using the ``import`` statement. In our example
   earlier, we imported the module ``string`` and then used the
   ``join()`` function from that module. By adding ``string.`` to the
   beginning of ``join()``, we make it clear to the Python interpreter
   that the definition of ``join()`` is given in the ``string``
   module. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to use the
   ``from`` *module* ``import`` *identifier* statement, as shown in the
   next example:

    >>> from string import join
    >>> join(chomsky)
    'colorless green ideas sleep furiously'  
    >>>

In this case, the name ``join`` is added to all the other identifier that we
have defined in the body of our programme, and we can use it to call a
function like any other.

.. Note:: If you are creating a file to contain some of your Python
   code, do *not* name your file ``nltk.py``: it may get imported in
   place of the "real" NLTK package. (When it imports modules, Python
   first looks in the current folder / directory.)

Formatting Output
-----------------

The output of a program is usually structured to make the information
easily digestible by a reader.  Instead of running some code and then
manually inspecting the contents of a variable, we would like the code
to tabulate some output.  We already saw this above in the first
``for`` loop example that used a list of words,
where each line of output was similar to ``5 p sleep``,
consisting of a word length, the last character of the word,
then the word itself.

There are many ways we might want to format such output.  For
instance, we might want to place the length value in parentheses `after`:em: the
word, and print all the output on a single line:

    >>> for word in chomsky:
    ...     print word, '(', len(word), '),',
    colorless ( 9 ), green ( 5 ), ideas ( 5 ), sleep ( 5 ), furiously ( 9 ),
    >>>

However, this approach has a couple of problems.  First, the ``print``
statement intermingles variables and punctuation, making it a little
difficult to read.  Second, the output has spaces around every item
that was printed.  A cleaner way to produce structured output uses
Python's `string formatting expressions`:dt:. Before diving into
clever formatting tricks, however, let's look at a really simple example. We
are going to use a special symbol, ``%s``, as a placeholder in
strings. Once we have a string containing this placeholder, we follow
it with a single ``%``
and then a value ``v``. Python then returns a new string where
``v`` has been slotted in to replace ``%s``:

    >>> "I want a %s right now" % "coffee"
    'I want a coffee right now'
    >>>

In fact, we can have a number of placeholders, but following the ``%`` operator
we need to specify exactly the same number of values.  Note that the
parentheses are required.

    >>> "%s wants a %s %s" % ("Lee", "sandwich", "for lunch")
    'Lee wants a sandwich for lunch'
    >>>

We can also provide the values for the placeholders indirectly. Here's
an example using a ``for`` loop:

    >>> menu = ['sandwich', 'spam fritter', 'pancake']
    >>> for snack in menu:
    ...     "Lee wants a %s right now" % snack
    ... 
    'Lee wants a sandwich right now'
    'Lee wants a spam fritter right now'
    'Lee wants a pancake right now'
    >>>

We oversimplified things when we said that placeholders were
of the form ``%s``; in fact, this is a complex object, called a
`conversion specifier`:dt:. This has to start with the ``%``
character, and ends with conversion character such as ``s` or ``d``. The ``%s``
specifier tells Python that the corresponding variable is a string (or
should be converted into a string), while the ``%d`` specifier
indicates that the corresponding variable should be converted into a
decimal representation. The string containing conversion specifiers is
called a `format string`:dt:.

Picking up on the ``print`` example that we opened this section with,
here's how we can use two different kinds of conversion specifier:

    >>> for word in chomsky:
    ...     print "%s (%d)," % (word, len(word)),
    colorless (9), green (5), ideas (5), sleep (5), furiously (9), 
    >>>

To summarize, string formatting is accomplished with a three-part
object having the syntax: `format`:ph: ``%`` `values`:ph:.  The
`format`:ph: section is a string containing format specifiers
such as ``%s`` and ``%d`` that Python will replace with the supplied
values.  The `values`:ph: section of a formatting string is a parenthesized
list containing exactly as many items as there are format specifiers in the
`format`:ph: section.  In the case that there is just one item, the
parentheses can be left out.  (We will discuss Python's
string-formatting expressions in more detail in Section
sec-presenting-results_).

In the above example, we used a trailing comma to suppress the
printing of a newline. Suppose, on the other hand, that we want to
introduce some additional newlines in our output. We can accomplish
this by inserting the "special" character ``\n`` into the ``print`` string:

    >>> for word in chomsky:
    ...	   print "Word = %s\nIndex = %s\n*****" % (word, chomsky.index(word))
    ...
    Word = colorless
    Index = 0
    *****
    Word = green
    Index = 1
    *****
    Word = ideas
    Index = 2
    *****
    Word = sleep
    Index = 3
    *****
    Word = furiously
    Index = 4
    *****
    >>> 



----------
Conclusion
----------

In this chapter we saw that we can do a variety of interesting
language processing tasks that focus solely on words.  Tokenization
turns out to be far more difficult than expected.
No single solution works well across-the-board, and we
must decide what counts as a token depending on the application
domain.  We also looked at normalization (including lemmatization) and
saw how it collapses distinctions between tokens.  In the next chapter
we will look at word classes and automatic tagging.

Summary
-------

* Text is represented in Python using strings, and we type these with
  single or double quotes: ``'Hello'``, ``"World"``.
* The characters of a string are accessed using indexes, counting from zero:
  ``'Hello World'[1]`` gives the value ``e``.  The length of a string is
  found using ``len()``.
* Substrings are accessed using slice notation: ``'Hello World'[1:5]``
  gives the value ``ello``.  If the start index is omitted, the
  substring begins at the start of the string; if the end index is omitted,
  the slice continues to the end of the string.
* Strings can be split into lists: ``'Hello World'.split()`` gives
  ``['Hello', 'World']``.  Lists can be joined into strings:
  ``'/'.join(['Hello', 'World'])`` gives ``'Hello/World'``.
* we can read text from a file ``f`` using ``text = open(f).read()``
* we can read text from a URL ``u`` using ``text = urlopen(u).read()``
* texts found on the web may contain unwanted material (such as headers, footers, markup),
  that need to be removed before we do any linguistic processing.
* Some functions are not available by default, but must be accessed using
  Python's ``import`` statement.
* a word token is an individual occurrence of a word in a particular context
* a word type is the vocabulary item, independent of any particular use of that item
* tokenization is the segmentation of a text into basic units |mdash| or tokens |mdash|
  such as words and punctuation.
* tokenization based on whitespace is inadequate for many applications because it
  bundles punctuation together with words
* lemmatization is a process that maps the various forms of a word (such as `appeared`:lx:, `appears`:lx:)
  to the canonical or citation form of the word, also known as the lexeme or lemma (e.g. `appear`:lex:).
* Regular expressions are a powerful and flexible method of specifying
  patterns. Once we have imported the ``re`` module, we can use
  ``re.findall()`` to find all substrings in a string that match a pattern,
  and we can use ``re.sub()`` to replace substrings of one sort with another.

#. |easy| Create a small text file, and write a program to read it and print it
   with a line number at the start of each line.  (Make sure you don't introduce
   an extra blank line between each line.)

#. |soso| Write code to read a file and print the lines in reverse order,
   so that the last line is listed first.

#. |soso| Read in some text from a corpus, tokenize it, and print the list of
   all `wh`:lx:\ -word types that occur.  (`wh`:lx:\ -words in English
   are used in questions, relative clauses and exclamations:
   `who`:lx:, `which`:lx:, `what`:lx:, and so on.) Print
   them in order.  Are any words duplicated in this list, because of
   the presence of case distinctions or punctuation?

#. |soso| Write code to access a favorite webpage and extract some text from it.
   For example, access a weather site and extract the forecast top
   temperature for your town or city today.

#. |soso| Write a function ``unknown()`` that takes a URL as its argument,
   and returns a list of unknown words that occur on that webpage.
   In order to do this, extract all substrings consisting of lowercase letters
   (using ``re.findall()``) and remove any items from this set that occur
   in the words corpus (``nltk.corpus.words``).  Try to categorize these words
   manually and discuss your findings.

       multiplication, such as ``2*3+8``.

#. |soso| The above example of extracting (name, domain) pairs from
   text does not work when there is more than one email address
   on a line, because the ``+`` operator is "greedy" and consumes
   too much of the input.

   a) Experiment with input text containing more than one email address
      per line, such as that shown below.  What happens?
   #) Using ``re.findall()``, write another regular expression
      to extract email addresses, replacing the period character
      with a range or negated range, such as ``[a-z]+`` or ``[^ >]+``.
   #) Now try to match email addresses by changing the regular
      expression ``.+`` to its "non-greedy" counterpart, ``.+?``

#. |soso| Write code to convert text into *hAck3r* again, this time using regular expressions
   and substitution, where
   ``e`` |rarr| ``3``,
   ``i`` |rarr| ``1``,
   ``o`` |rarr| ``0``,
   ``l`` |rarr| ``|``,
   ``s`` |rarr| ``5``,
   ``.`` |rarr| ``5w33t!``,
   ``ate`` |rarr| ``8``.
   Normalize the text to lowercase before converting it.
   Add more substitutions of your own.  Now try to map
   ``s`` to two different values: ``$`` for word-initial ``s``,
   and ``5`` for word-internal ``s``.

#. |soso| *Pig Latin* is a simple transliteration of English.  Each word of the
   text is converted as follows: move any consonant (or consonant cluster)
   that appears at the start of the word to the end,
   then append `ay`:lx:, e.g. `string`:lx: |rarr| `ingstray`:lx:,
   `idle`:lx: |rarr| `idleay`:lx:.  ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin``

   a) Write a function to convert a word to Pig Latin.

   b) Write code that converts text, instead of individual words.

   c) Extend it further to preserve capitalization, to keep ``qu`` together
      (i.e. so that ``quiet`` becomes ``ietquay``), and to detect when ``y``
      is used as a consonant (e.g. ``yellow``) vs a vowel (e.g. ``style``).

#. |hard| An interesting challenge for tokenization is words that have been
   split across a line-break.  E.g. if *long-term* is split, then we
   have the string ``long-\nterm``.

   a) Write a regular expression that identifies words that are
      hyphenated at a line-break.  The expression will need to include the
      ``\n`` character.

   b) Use ``re.sub()`` to remove the ``\n`` character from these
      words.

#. |easy| Write a utility function that takes a URL as its argument, and returns
   the contents of the URL, with all HTML markup removed.  Use ``urllib.urlopen``
   to access the contents of the URL, e.g.
   ``raw_contents = urllib.urlopen('http://nltk.org/').read()``.

#. |soso| Download some text from a language that has vowel harmony (e.g. Hungarian),
   extract the vowel sequences of words, and create a vowel bigram table.

#. |hard| Read the Wikipedia entry on *Soundex*.  Implement this
   algorithm in Python.

#. |hard| Define a function ``percent(word, text)`` that calculates
   how often a given word occurs in a text, and expresses the result
   as a percentage.

#. |easy| **Regular expression tokenizers:**
   Save some text into a file ``corpus.txt``.  Define a function ``load(f)``
   that reads from the file named in its sole argument, and returns a string
   containing the text of the file.

   a) Use ``nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize()`` to create a tokenizer that tokenizes
      the various kinds of punctuation in this text.  Use a single
      regular expression, with inline comments using the
      ``re.VERBOSE`` flag.
   b) Use ``nltk.tokenize.regexp_tokenize()`` to create a tokenizer that tokenizes
      the following kinds of expression: monetary amounts; dates; names
      of people and companies.

#. |easy| Rewrite the following loop as a list comprehension:

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> result = []
    >>> for word in sent:
    ...     word_len = (word, len(word))
    ...     result.append(word_len)
    >>> result
    [('The', 3), ('dog', 3), ('gave', 4), ('John', 4), ('the', 3), ('newspaper', 9)]

#. |soso| Consider the numeric expressions in the following sentence from
   the MedLine corpus: `The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these
   sera were 4.53 +/- 0.15% and 8.16 +/- 0.23%, respectively.`:lx:
   Should we say that the numeric expression `4.53 +/- 0.15%`:lx: is three
   words?  Or should we say that it's a single compound word?  Or should
   we say that it is actually *nine* words, since it's read "four point
   five three, plus or minus fifteen percent"?  Or should we say that
   it's not a "real" word at all, since it wouldn't appear in any dictionary?
   Discuss these different possibilities.  Can you think of application domains
   that motivate at least two of these answers?

#. |soso| Readability measures are used to score the reading difficulty of a
   text, for the purposes of selecting texts of appropriate difficulty
   for language learners.  Let us define
   |mu|\ :subscript:`w` to be the average number of letters per word, and
   |mu|\ :subscript:`s` to be the average number of words per sentence, in
   a given text.  The Automated Readability Index (ARI) of the text
   is defined to be:
   ``4.71 * `` |mu|\ :subscript:`w` ``+ 0.5 * `` |mu|\ :subscript:`s` ``- 21.43``.
   Compute the ARI score for various sections of the Brown Corpus, including
   section ``f`` (popular lore) and ``j`` (learned).  Make use of the fact that
   ``nltk.corpus.brown.words()`` produces a sequence of words, while
   ``nltk.corpus.brown.sents()`` produces a sequence of sentences.

#. |hard| Obtain raw texts from two or more genres and compute their respective
   reading difficulty scores as in the previous exercise.
   E.g. compare ABC Rural News and ABC Science News (``nltk.corpus.abc``).
   Use Punkt to perform sentence segmentation.

#. |hard| Rewrite the following nested loop as a nested list comprehension:

    >>> words = ['attribution', 'confabulation', 'elocution',
    ...          'sequoia', 'tenacious', 'unidirectional']
    >>> vsequences = set()
    >>> for word in words:
    ...     vowels = []
    ...     for char in word:
    ...         if char in 'aeiou':
    ...             vowels.append(char)
    ...     vsequences.add(''.join(vowels))
    >>> sorted(vsequences)
    ['aiuio', 'eaiou', 'eouio', 'euoia', 'oauaio', 'uiieioa']    

    .. sorted(set(''.join(c for c in word if c in 'aeiou') for word in words))

#. |soso| Use the Porter Stemmer to normalize some tokenized text, calling
   the stemmer on each word.  Do the same thing with the Lancaster Stemmer
   and see if you observe any differences.

#. |easy| Split ``sent`` on some other character, such as ``'s'``.

#. |easy| We pointed out that when ``phrase`` is a list, ``phrase.reverse()``
   returns a modified version of ``phrase`` rather than a new list. On
   the other hand, we can use the slice trick mentioned in the
   exercises for the previous section, ``[::-1]`` to create a `new`:em: reversed list
   without changing ``phrase``. Show how you can confirm this
   difference in behavior.

#. |easy| We have seen how to represent a sentence as a list of words, where
   each word is a sequence of characters.  What does ``phrase1[2][2]`` do?
   Why?  Experiment with other index values.

#. |easy| Write a ``for`` loop to print out the characters of a string, one per line.

#. |easy| What is the difference between calling ``split`` on a string
   with no argument or with ``' '`` as the argument,
   e.g. ``sent.split()`` versus ``sent.split(' ')``?  What happens
   when the string being split contains tab characters, consecutive
   space characters, or a sequence of tabs and spaces?  (In IDLE you
   will need to use ``'\t'`` to enter a tab character.)

#. |easy| Create a variable ``words`` containing a list of words.
   Experiment with ``words.sort()`` and ``sorted(words)``.
   What is the difference?

#. |easy| Earlier, we asked you to use a text editor to create a file
   called ``test.py``, containing the single line ``msg = 'Hello
   World'``. If you haven't already done this (or can't find the file),
   go ahead and do it now. Next, start up a new session with the
   Python interpreter, and enter the expression ``msg`` at the prompt.
   You will get an error from the interpreter. Now, try the following
   (note that you have to leave off the ``.py`` part of the filename):

       >>> from test import msg
       >>> msg

   This time, Python should return with a value. You can also try
   ``import test``, in which case Python should be able to
   evaluate the expression ``test.msg`` at the prompt.  

#. |soso| Process the list ``chomsky`` using a ``for`` loop, and store the
   result in a new list ``lengths``.  Hint: begin by assigning the
   empty list to ``lengths``, using ``lengths = []``. Then each time
   through the loop, use ``append()`` to add another length value to
   the list.

#. |soso| Define a variable ``silly`` to contain the string:
   ``'newly formed bland ideas are inexpressible in an infuriating
   way'``.  (This happens to be the legitimate interpretation that
   bilingual English-Spanish speakers can assign to Chomsky's
   famous phrase, according to Wikipedia).  Now write code to perform
   the following tasks:

   a) Split ``silly`` into a list of strings, one per
      word, using Python's ``split()`` operation, and save
      this to a variable called ``bland``.
   b) Extract the second letter of each word in ``silly`` and join
      them into a string, to get ``'eoldrnnnna'``.
   c) Combine the words in ``bland`` back into a single string, using ``join()``.
      Make sure the words in the resulting string are separated with
      whitespace.
   d) Print the words of ``silly`` in alphabetical order, one per line.

#. |soso| The ``index()`` function can be used to look up items in sequences.
   For example, ``'inexpressible'.index('e')`` tells us the index of the
   first position of the letter ``e``.

   a) What happens when you look up a substring, e.g. ``'inexpressible'.index('re')``?
   b) Define a variable ``words`` containing a list of words.  Now use ``words.index()``
      to look up the position of an individual word.
   c) Define a variable ``silly`` as in the exercise above.
      Use the ``index()`` function in combination with list slicing to
      build a list ``phrase`` consisting of all the words up to (but not
      including) ``in`` in ``silly``.

#. |soso| Write code to abbreviate text by removing all the vowels.
   Define ``sentence`` to hold any string you like, then initialize
   a new string ``result`` to hold the empty string ``''``.  Now write
   a ``for`` loop to process the string, one character at a time,
   and append any non-vowel characters to the result string.

#. |hard| Write a program that processes a text and discovers
   cases where a word has been used with a novel sense.
   For each word, compute the wordnet similarity
   between all synsets of the word and all synsets of the
   words in its context.  (Note that this is a crude
   approach; doing it well is an open research problem.)
