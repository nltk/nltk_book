4. Categorizing and Tagging Words
=================================

Back in elementary school you learnt the difference between nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs.  These "word classes" are not just
the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many
language processing tasks.  As we will see, they arise from simple analysis
of the distribution of words in text.  The goal of this chapter is to
answer the following questions:

#. What are lexical categories and how are they used in natural language processing?
#. What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories?
#. How can we automatically tag each word of a text with its word class?

Along the way, we'll cover some fundamental techniques in NLP, including
sequence labeling, n-gram models, backoff, and evaluation.  These techniques
are useful in many areas, and tagging gives us a simple context in which
to present them.

Before we go further, let's look for words based on similar distribution
in a text.  We will look up `woman`:lx: (a noun), `bought`:lx: (a verb),
`over`:lx: (a preposition), and `the`:lx: (a determiner), using
|NLTK|\ 's ``Text.similar()`` function:

    >>> text = nltk.Text(word.lower() for word in nltk.corpus.brown.words())
    >>> text.similar('woman')
    man number fact end time world use kind state matter house result way
    group part day rest sense couple be
    >>> text.similar('bought')
    able been made found used was had said have that given in expected as
    told put taken got seen done
    >>> text.similar('over')
    of in to on at for was is with that from and into by all as out up back the
    >>> text.similar('the')
    a his this that it their one her an all in its any which our some he
    these my be

This function takes a word `w`:math:, finds all contexts
`w`:math:\ `1`:subscript:\ `w`:math: `w`:math:\ `2`:subscript:,
then finds all words `w'`:math: that appear in the same context,
i.e. `w`:math:\ `1`:subscript:\ `w'`:math:\ `w`:math:\ `2`:subscript:.
(You can find the implementation online at ``http://nltk.org/nltk/text.py``)    

Observe that searching for `woman`:lx: finds *nouns*;
searching for `bought`:lx: finds *verbs*;
searching for `over`:lx: generally finds *prepositions*;
searching for `the`:lx: finds several *determiners*.
This simple method of finding distributionally similar words is
not a reliable way of categorizing English words.

These groups of words are so important that they have several names,
all in common use: `word classes`:dt:, `lexical categories`:dt:, and `parts of speech`:dt:.
We'll use these names interchangeably.

The process of classifying words into their parts-of-speech and
labeling them accordingly is known as `part-of-speech tagging`:dt:,
`POS-tagging`:dt:, or simply `tagging`:dt:.  The collection of tags
used for a particular task is known as a `tag set`:dt:.  Our emphasis
in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically.

.. note:: Remember that our program samples assume you
   begin your interactive session or your program with: ``import nltk, re, pprint``

A Simplified Part-of-Speech Tagset
----------------------------------

Tagged corpora use many different conventions for tagging words.
To help us get started, we will be looking at a simplified tagset
(shown in Table simplified-tagset_).


.. table:: simplified-tagset

    =======  ===================  ==========================================
    Tag      Meaning              Examples
    =======  ===================  ==========================================
    ``ADJ``  adjective            `new, good, high, special, big, local`:lx:
    ``ADV``  adverb               `really, already, still, early, now`:lx:
    ``CNJ``  conjunction          `and, or, but, if, while, although`:lx:
    ``DET``  determiner           `the, a, some, most, every, no`:lx:
    ``EX``   existential          `there, there's`:lx:
    ``FW``   foreign word         `dolce, ersatz, esprit, quo, maitre`:lx:
    ``MOD``  modal verb           `will, can, would, may, must, should`:lx:
    ``N``    noun                 `year, home, costs, time, education`:lx:
    ``NP``   proper noun          `Alison, Africa, April, Washington`:lx:
    ``NUM``  number               `twenty-four, fourth, 1991, 14:24`:lx: 
    ``PRO``  pronoun              `he, their, her, its, my, I, us`:lx:
    ``P``    preposition          `on, of, at, with, by, into, under`:lx:

    ``WH``   `wh`:lx: determiner  `who, which, when, what, where, how`:lx:
    =======  ===================  ==========================================

    Simplified Part-of-Speech Tagset

Let's see which of these tags are the most common in the news
category of the Brown corpus:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> brown_news_tagged = brown.tagged_words(categories='news', simplify_tags=True)
    >>> tag_fd = nltk.FreqDist(tag for (word, tag) in brown_news_tagged)
    >>> tag_fd.keys()
    ['N', 'P', 'DET', 'NP', 'V', 'ADJ', ',', '.', 'CNJ', 'PRO', 'ADV', 'VD', ...]

.. note:: |TRY|
   Plot the above frequency distribution using ``tag_fd.plot(cumulative=True)``.
   What percentage of words are tagged using the first five tags of the above list? 

We can use these tags to do powerful concordance searches using
``nltk.draw.pos_concordance()``.

.. Screenshot

Reading Tagged Corpora
----------------------

Several of the corpora included with NLTK have been `tagged`:dt: for
their part-of-speech. Here's an example of what you might see if you
opened a file from the Brown Corpus with a text editor:

    The/at Fulton/np-tl County/nn-tl Grand/jj-tl Jury/nn-tl
    said/vbd Friday/nr an/at investigation/nn of/in Atlanta's/np$
    recent/jj primary/nn election/nn produced/vbd ``/`` no/at
    evidence/nn ''/'' that/cs any/dti irregularities/nns took/vbd
    place/nn ./.

However, other tagged corpus files represent their part-of-speech tags
in different ways. |NLTK|\ 's corpus readers provide a uniform
interface to these various formats so that you don't have to be
concerned with them.  By contrast with the text extract shown above,
the corpus reader for the Brown Corpus presents the data as follows:

    >>> list(nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words())[:25]
    [('The', 'AT'), ('Fulton', 'NP-TL'), ('County', 'NN-TL'), ...] 

Part-of-speech tags have been converted to uppercase, since this has
become standard practice since the Brown Corpus was published.

Whenever a corpus contains tagged text, it will have a ``tagged_words()``
method. Here are some more examples, again using the output format
illustrated for the Brown Corpus:

    >>> print nltk.corpus.nps_chat.tagged_words()
    [('now', 'RB'), ('im', 'PRP'), ('left', 'VBD'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.conll2000.tagged_words()
    [('Confidence', 'NN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words()
    [('Pierre', 'NNP'), ('Vinken', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ...]

Not all corpora employ the same set of tags; please see the ``README``
file included with each corpus for documentation of its tagset.
Initially we want to avoid the complications of these tagsets,
so we use a built-in mapping to a simplified tagset:

    >>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(simplify_tags=True)
    [('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NP'), ('County', 'N'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words(simplify_tags=True)
    [('Pierre', 'NP'), ('Vinken', 'NP'), (',', ','), ...]
    
Tagged corpora for several other languages are distributed with NLTK,
including Chinese, Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Catalan.
These usually contain non-ASCII text,
and Python always displays this in hexadecimal when printing a larger structure
such as a list.

    >>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.tagged_words()
    [('\xe4\xb8\x80', 'Neu'), ('\xe5\x8f\x8b\xe6\x83\x85', 'Nad'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.indian.tagged_words()
    [('\xe0\xa6\xae\xe0\xa6\xb9\xe0\xa6\xbf\xe0\xa6\xb7\xe0\xa7\x87\xe0\xa6\xb0', 'NN'),
    ('\xe0\xa6\xb8\xe0\xa6\xa8\xe0\xa7\x8d\xe0\xa6\xa4\xe0\xa6\xbe\xe0\xa6\xa8', 'NN'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.mac_morpho.tagged_words()
    [('Jersei', 'N'), ('atinge', 'V'), ('m\xe9dia', 'N'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.conll2002.tagged_words()
    [('Sao', 'NC'), ('Paulo', 'VMI'), ('(', 'Fpa'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.cess_cat.tagged_words()
    [('El', 'da0ms0'), ('Tribunal_Suprem', 'np0000o'), ...]

If your environment is set up correctly, with appropriate editors and fonts,
you should be able to display individual strings in a human-readable way.
For example, Figure fig-tag-indian_ shows the output of the demonstration code 
``nltk.corpus.indian.demo()``.

.. _fig-tag-indian:
.. figure:: ../images/tag-indian.png
   :scale: 60

   POS-Tagged Data from Four Indian Languages

If the corpus is also segmented into sentences, it will have
a ``tagged_sents()`` method that divides up the tagged words into
sentences rather than presenting them as one big list.
This will be useful when we come to training automatic taggers,
as they typically function on a sentence at a time.

Nouns
-----

Nouns generally refer to people, places, things, or concepts, e.g.:
`woman, Scotland, book, intelligence`:lx:.  Nouns can appear after
determiners and adjectives, and can be the subject or object of the
verb, as shown in Table syntax-nouns_.

.. table:: syntax-nouns

   ============    =============================================  ==================================================
   Word            After a determiner                             Subject of the verb
   ============    =============================================  ==================================================
   woman           *the* woman who I saw yesterday ...            the woman *sat* down
   Scotland        *the* Scotland I remember as a child ...       Scotland *has* five million people
   book            *the* book I bought yesterday ...              this book *recounts* the colonization of Australia
   intelligence    *the* intelligence displayed by the child ...  Mary's intelligence *impressed* her teachers
   ============    =============================================  ==================================================

   Syntactic Patterns involving some Nouns

The simplified noun tags are ``N`` for common nouns like `book`:lx:,
and ``NP`` for proper nouns like `Scotland`:lx:.

Let's inspect some tagged text to see what parts of speech occur before a noun,
with the most frequent ones first. To begin with, we construct a list
of bigrams whose members are themselves word-tag pairs such as
``(('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NP'))`` and  ``(('Fulton', 'NP'), ('County', 'N'))``.
Then we construct a ``FreqDist`` from the tag parts of the bigrams.

    >>> word_tag_pairs = nltk.bigrams(brown_news_tagged)
    >>> list(nltk.FreqDist(a[1] for (a, b) in word_tag_pairs if b[1] == 'N'))
    ['DET', 'ADJ', 'N', 'P', 'NP', 'NUM', 'V', 'PRO', 'CNJ', '.', ',', 'VG', 'VN', ...]

This confirms our assertion that nouns occur after determiners and
adjectives, including numeral adjectives (tagged as ``NUM``). 

.. TO-DO say something about some of the other contexts?


Verbs
-----

Verbs are words that describe events and actions, e.g. `fall`:lx:,
`eat`:lx: in Table syntax-verbs_.
In the context of a sentence, verbs typically express a relation
involving the referents of one or more noun phrases.

.. table:: syntax-verbs

   =====  ===============  ===============================================
   Word   Simple           With modifiers and adjuncts (italicized)
   =====  ===============  ===============================================
   fall   Rome fell        Dot com stocks *suddenly* fell *like a stone*
   eat    Mice eat cheese  John ate the pizza *with gusto*
   =====  ===============  ===============================================

   Syntactic Patterns involving some Verbs


What are the most common verbs in news text?  Let's sort all the verbs by frequency:

    >>> wsj = nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words(simplify_tags=True)
    >>> word_tag_fd = nltk.FreqDist(wsj)
    >>> [word + "/" + tag for (word, tag) in word_tag_fd if tag.startswith('V')]
    ['is/V', 'said/VD', 'was/VD', 'are/V', 'be/V', 'has/V', 'have/V', 'says/V',
    'were/VD', 'had/VD', 'been/VN', "'s/V", 'do/V', 'say/V', 'make/V', 'did/VD',
    'rose/VD', 'does/V', 'expected/VN', 'buy/V', 'take/V', 'get/V', 'sell/V',
    'help/V', 'added/VD', 'including/VG', 'according/VG', 'made/VN', 'pay/V']

.. note::
   We found the relevant part-of-speech tags using ``tag.startswith('V')``.  We could
   also have written ``tag[0] == 'V'``.  However, we think that the former
   choice is preferrable as it is more readable (even though it is slightly
   less efficient).

Note that the items being counted in the frequency distribution are word-tag pairs.
Since words and tags are paired, we can treat the word as a condition and the tag
as an event, and initialize a conditional frequency distribution with a list of
condition-event pairs.  This lets us see a frequency-ordered list of tags given a word:

    >>> cfd1 = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(wsj)
    >>> cfd1['yield'].keys()
    ['N', 'V']
    >>> cfd1['cut'].keys()
    ['V', 'VD', 'N', 'VN']

We can reverse the order of the pairs, so that the tags are the conditions, and the
words are the events.  Now we can see likely words for a given tag:

    >>> cfd2 = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist((tag, word) for (word, tag) in wsj)
    >>> cfd2['VN'].keys()
    ['been', 'expected', 'made', 'compared', 'based', 'priced', 'used', 'sold',
    'named', 'designed', 'held', 'fined', 'taken', 'paid', 'traded', 'said', ...]

To clarify the distinction between ``VD`` (past tense) and ``VN``
(past participle), let's find words which can be both ``VD`` and
``VN``, and see some surrounding text:

    >>> [w for w in cfd1.conditions() if 'VD' in cfd1[w] and 'VN' in cfd1[w]]
    ['Asked', 'accelerated', 'accepted', 'accused', 'acquired', 'added', 'adopted', ...]
    >>> idx1 = wsj.index(('kicked', 'VD'))
    >>> wsj[idx1-4:idx1+1]
    [('While', 'P'), ('program', 'N'), ('trades', 'N'), ('swiftly', 'ADV'), ('kicked', 'VD')]
    >>> idx2 = wsj.index(('kicked', 'VN'))
    >>> wsj[idx2-4:idx2+2]
    [('head', 'N'), ('of', 'P'), ('state', 'N'), ('has', 'V'), ('kicked', 'VN')]

In this case, we see that the past participle of `kicked`:lx: is preceded by a form of
the auxiliary verb `have`:lx:. Is this generally true?

.. note:: |TRY|
   Given the list of past participles in specified by
   ``cfd2['VN'].keys()``, try to collect a list of all the word-tag
   pairs that immediately precede items in that list. 

Adjectives and Adverbs
----------------------

Two other important word classes are `adjectives`:dt: and `adverbs`:dt:.
Adjectives describe nouns, and can be used as modifiers
(e.g. `large`:lx: in `the large pizza`:lx:), or in predicates (e.g. `the
pizza is large`:lx:).  English adjectives can be morphologically complex
(e.g.  `fall`:lx:\ :subscript:`V`\ `+ing`:lx: in `the falling
stocks`:lx:).  Adverbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place or
direction of the event described by the verb (e.g. `quickly`:lx: in
`the stocks fell quickly`:lx:).  Adverbs may also modify adjectives
(e.g. `really`:lx: in `Mary's teacher was really nice`:lx:).

English has several categories of closed class words in addition to
prepositions, such as `articles`:dt: (also often called `determiners`:dt:)
(e.g., `the`:lx:, `a`:lx:), `modals`:dt: (e.g., `should`:lx:,
`may`:lx:), and `personal pronouns`:dt: (e.g., `she`:lx:, `they`:lx:).
Each dictionary and grammar classifies these words differently.

.. note:: |TRY|
   If you are uncertain about some of these parts of speech, study them using
   ``nltk.draw.pos_concordance()``, or watch some of the *Schoolhouse Rock!*
   grammar videos available at YouTube.

Tuples
------

By convention in NLTK, a tagged token is represented using a Python
`tuple`:dt:.
Python tuples are just like lists, except for one important
difference: tuples cannot be changed in place, for example by
``sort()`` or ``reverse()``. In other words, like strings, they are
immutable. Tuples are formed with the comma operator, and typically enclosed
using parentheses.  Like lists, tuples can be indexed and sliced:

.. doctest-ignore::
   >>> t = ('walk', 'fem', 3)
   >>> t[0]
   'walk'
   >>> t[1:]
   ('fem', 3)
   >>> t[0] = 'run'
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
   TypeError: object does not support item assignment

A tagged token is represented using a tuple consisting of just two items.
We can create one of these special tuples from the standard string
representation of a tagged token, using the function ``str2tuple()``:

    >>> tagged_token = nltk.tag.str2tuple('fly/NN')
    >>> tagged_token
    ('fly', 'NN')
    >>> tagged_token[0]
    'fly'
    >>> tagged_token[1]
    'NN'

We can construct a list of tagged tokens directly from a string.  The first
step is to tokenize the string
to access the individual ``word/tag`` strings, and then to convert
each of these into a tuple (using ``str2tuple()``).

    >>> sent = '''
    ... The/AT grand/JJ jury/NN commented/VBD on/IN a/AT number/NN of/IN
    ... other/AP topics/NNS ,/, AMONG/IN them/PPO the/AT Atlanta/NP and/CC
    ... Fulton/NP-tl County/NN-tl purchasing/VBG departments/NNS which/WDT it/PPS
    ... said/VBD ``/`` ARE/BER well/QL operated/VBN and/CC follow/VB generally/RB
    ... accepted/VBN practices/NNS which/WDT inure/VB to/IN the/AT best/JJT
    ... interest/NN of/IN both/ABX governments/NNS ''/'' ./.
    ... '''
    >>> [nltk.tag.str2tuple(t) for t in sent.split()]
    [('The', 'AT'), ('grand', 'JJ'), ('jury', 'NN'), ('commented', 'VBD'),
    ('on', 'IN'), ('a', 'AT'), ('number', 'NN'), ... ('.', '.')]

Unsimplified Tags
-----------------

Let's find the most frequent nouns of each noun
part-of-speech type.  The program in Figure findtags_ finds all
tags starting with `NN`:gc:, and provides a few example words for each
one.  Observe that there are many noun tags; the most important
of these have ``$`` for possessive nouns, `S`:gc: for plural nouns (since plural
nouns typically end in `s`:lx:), `P`:gc: for proper nouns.

.. pylisting:: findtags
   :caption: Program to Find the Most Frequent Noun Tags

    def findtags(tag_prefix, tagged_text):
        cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist((word, tag) for (word, tag) in tagged_text
                                      if tag.startswith(tag_prefix))
        return dict((tag, cfd[tag].keys()[:5]) for tag in cfd.conditions())

    >>> tagdict = findtags('NN', nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(categories='news'))
    >>> for tag in sorted(tagdict):
    ...     print tag, tagdict[tag]
   
    NN ['year', 'time', 'state', 'week', 'man']
    NN$ ["year's", "world's", "state's", "nation's", "company's"]
    NN$-HL ["Golf's", "Navy's"]
    NN$-TL ["President's", "University's", "League's", "Gallery's", "Army's"]
    NN-HL ['cut', 'Salary', 'condition', 'Question', 'business']
    NN-NC ['eva', 'ova', 'aya']
    NN-TL ['President', 'House', 'State', 'University', 'City']
    NN-TL-HL ['Fort', 'City', 'Commissioner', 'Grove', 'House']
    NNS ['years', 'members', 'people', 'sales', 'men']
    NNS$ ["children's", "women's", "men's", "janitors'", "taxpayers'"]
    NNS$-HL ["Dealers'", "Idols'"]
    NNS$-TL ["Women's", "States'", "Giants'", "Officers'", "Bombers'"]
    NNS-HL ['years', 'idols', 'Creations', 'thanks', 'centers']
    NNS-TL ['States', 'Nations', 'Masters', 'Rules', 'Communists']
    NNS-TL-HL ['Nations']

Some tags contain a plus sign; these are compound tags, and are
assigned to words that contain two parts normally treated separately.
Some tags contain a minus sign; this indicates disjunction.

When we come to constructing part-of-speech taggers later in this chapter,
we will use the unsimplified tags.

Exploring Tagged Corpora (NOTES)
--------------------------------

We can continue the kinds of exploration of corpora we saw in previous chapters,
but exploiting the tags...

Suppose we're studying the word `often`:lx: and want to see how it is used
in text.  We could ask to see the following words:

    >>> brown_news_text = brown.tagged_words(categories='news', simplify_tags=True)
    >>> word_pairs = nltk.bigrams(brown_news_text)
    >>> list(nltk.FreqDist(b for (a, b) in word_pairs if a == 'often'))
    ['a', 'ambiguous', 'needs', 'mar', 'that', 'did', 'acceptable', ',', '.',
    'enough', 'hear', 'build', 'in', 'obstructed']

However, its probably more instructive to look at the part-of-speech tag of the following
words:

    >>> brown_news_tagged = brown.tagged_words(categories='news', simplify_tags=True)
    >>> word_tag_pairs = nltk.bigrams(tagged_text)
    >>> list(nltk.FreqDist(b[1] for (a, b) in word_tag_pairs if a[0] == 'often'))
    ['V', 'ADJ', 'DET', 'VD', ',', '.', 'P', 'VBZ', 'CNJ']

.. _sec-dictionaries:

-----------------------------------------------------
Mapping Words to Properties Using Python Dictionaries
-----------------------------------------------------

As we have seen, a tagged word of the form ``(word, tag)`` is
an association between a word and a part-of-speech tag.
Once we start doing part-of-speech tagging, we will be creating
programs that assign a tag to a word, the tag which is most
likely in a given context.  We can think of this process as
`mapping`:dt: from words to tags.  The most natural way to
store mappings in Python uses the dictionary data type.
In this section we look at dictionaries and see how they can
represent a variety of language information, including
parts of speech.

Indexing Lists vs Dictionaries
------------------------------

A text, as we have seen, is treated in Python as a list of words.
An important property of lists is that we can "look up" a particular
item by giving its index, e.g. ``text1[100]``.  Notice how we specify
a number, and get back a word.  We can think of a list as a simple
kind of table, as shown in Figure fig-maps01_.

.. _fig-maps01:
.. figure:: ../images/maps01.png
   :scale: 30

   List Look-up

Contrast this situation with frequency distributions (section sec-computing-with-language-simple-statistics_),
where we specify a word, and get back a number, e.g. ``fdist['monstrous']``, which
tells us the number of times a given word has occurred in a text.  Look-up using words is
familiar to anyone who has used a dictionary.  Some more examples are shown in
Figure fig-maps02_.

.. _fig-maps02:
.. figure:: ../images/maps02.png
   :scale: 22

   Dictionary Look-up

In the case of a phonebook, we look up an entry using a `name`:em:,
and get back a number.  When we type a domain name in a web browser,
the computer looks this up to get back an IP address.  A word
frequency table allows us to look up a word and find its frequency in
a text collection.  In all these cases, we are mapping from names to
numbers, rather than the other way round.
In general, we would like to be able to map between
arbitrary types of information.  Table linguistic-objects_ lists a variety
of linguistic objects, along with what they map.

.. table:: linguistic-objects

    Linguistic Objects as Mappings from Keys to Values

Most often, we are mapping from a "word" to some structured object.
For example, a document index maps from a word (which we can represent
as a string), to a list of pages (represented as a list of integers).
In this section, we will see how to represent such mappings in Python.

Dictionaries in Python
----------------------

Python provides a `dictionary`:dt: data type that can be used for
mapping between arbitrary types.  It is like a conventional dictionary,
in that it gives you an efficient way to look things up.  However,
as we see from Table linguistic-objects_, it has a much wider range of uses.
Here we define ``pos`` to be an empty dictionary and then add four
entries to it, specifying the part-of-speech of some words.  We add
entries to a dictionary using the familiar square bracket notation:

    >>> pos = {}
    >>> pos['colorless'] = 'ADJ'
    >>> pos['ideas'] = 'N'
    >>> pos['sleep'] = 'V'
    >>> pos['furiously'] = 'ADV'

So, for example, ``pos['colorless'] = 'ADJ'`` says that
the part-of-speech of `colorless`:lx: is adjective, or more
specifically, that the look-up value of the key ``'colorless'`` in ``pos``
is the value ``'ADJ'``.  Now we can look up our dictionary
using these keys:

    >>> pos['ideas']
    'N'
    >>> pos['colorless']
    'ADJ'
    >>> pos['missing']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    KeyError: 'missing'

This raises an important question.  Unlike lists and strings, where we
can use ``len()`` to work out which integers will be legal indices, how
do we work out the legal keys for a dictionary?  We simply convert the
dictionary to a list, or use the dictionary in a context where a list
is expected:

    >>> list(pos)
    ['ideas', 'furiously', 'colorless', 'sleep']
    >>> sorted(pos)
    ['colorless', 'furiously', 'ideas', 'sleep']
    >>> [w for w in pos if w.endswith('s')]
    ['colorless', 'ideas']

.. note::
   When you type `list(pos)` you might see a different order
   to the one shown above.  This is because
   dictionaries are not sequences but mappings (cf Figure fig-maps02_),
   and the keys are not inherently ordered.  If you want
   to see the keys in order, just sort them.

The last example above used a ``for`` loop to iterate over all keys
in the dictionary.  We can also use the ``for`` loop in another way,
just we did for printing lists:

    >>> for word in sorted(pos):
    ...     print word ":", pos[word]
    ... 
    colorless: ADJ
    furiously: ADV
    sleep: V
    ideas: N

We can see what the contents of the dictionary look like by inspecting
the variable ``pos``.

    >>> pos
    {'furiously': 'ADV', 'ideas': 'N', 'colorless': 'ADJ', 'sleep': 'V'}

Here, the contents of the dictionary are shown as `key-value pairs`:dt:,
separated by a colon.  As you can see,  the order of the key-value pairs
is different from the order in which they were originally entered.

We can use the same key-value pair format to create a dictionary:

    >>> pos = {'colorless': 'ADJ', 'ideas': 'N', 'sleep': 'V', 'furiously': 'ADV'}

Using the dictionary methods ``keys()``, ``values()`` and ``items()``,
we can access the keys, values, and key-value pairs as separate lists:

    >>> pos.keys()
    ['colorless', 'furiously', 'sleep', 'ideas']
    >>> pos.values()
    ['ADJ', 'ADV', 'V', 'N']
    >>> pos.items()
    [('colorless', 'ADJ'), ('furiously', 'ADV'), ('sleep', 'V'), ('ideas', 'N')]
    >>> for key, val in sorted(pos.items()):
    ...     print key ":", val
    ...
    colorless: ADJ
    furiously: ADV
    ideas: N
    sleep: V

Note that keys are forced to be unique.
Suppose we try to use a dictionary to store the fact that the
word `sleep`:lx: can be used as a verb and as a noun:

    >>> pos['sleep'] = 'V'
    >>> pos['sleep'] = 'N'
    >>> pos['sleep']
    'N'

Initially, ``pos['sleep']`` is given the value ``'V'``, and this is
immediately overwritten with the new value ``'N'``.
In other words, there is only one entry for ``'sleep'``.
If we wanted to store multiple values in that entry, we could use a list,
e.g. ``pos['sleep'] = ['N', 'V']``.  In fact, this is what we
saw in Section sec-lexical-resources_ for the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary,
so that we could store multiple pronunciations for a single word.

Default Dictionaries
--------------------

Since Python 2.5, a special kind of dictionary has been available, which
can automatically create a default entry for a given key.  (It is provided
as ``nltk.defaultdict`` for the benefit of readers who are using Python 2.4).
In order to use it, we have to supply a parameter which can be used to
create an empty entry, e.g. ``int``:

    >>> frequency = nltk.defaultdict(int)
    >>> frequency['colorless'] = 4
    >>> frequency['ideas']
    0

We can supply our own function to be used for creating the initial value.
Let's return to our part-of-speech example, and create a dictionary
whose default value for any entry is ``'N'``.

    >>> pos = nltk.defaultdict(lambda: 'N')
    >>> pos['colorless'] = 'ADJ'
    >>> pos['blog']
    'N'

.. note::
   The above example used a `lambda expression`:em:, an advanced feature
   we will study in section sec-functions_.  For now you just need to
   know that ``lambda: 'N'`` creates a function, and when we call this
   function it produces the value ``'N'``: 

      >>> f = lambda: 'N'
      >>> f()
      'N'

Incrementally Updating a Dictionary
----------------------------------- 

We can use dictionaries to count occurrences, emulating the
method used for tallying words (Figure fig-tally_).  We begin by initializing
an empty dictionary, then process each part-of-speech tag in the text.
If the tag hasn't been seen before, we add it to our list with a zero count.  If we've
seen it before we increment its count using the ``+=`` operator.

.. pylisting:: dictionary
   :caption: Incrementally Updating a Dictionary, and Sorting by Value

    >>> counts = nltk.defaultdict(int)
    >>> for (word, tag) in brown_news_tagged:
    ...     counts[tag] += 1
    ...
    >>> counts['N']
    22226
    >>> list(counts)[:40]
    ['FW', 'DET', 'WH', 'VBZ', 'ADJ', 'PRO', '-', 'TO', 'NUM', 'NP', ':', 'ADV', ...]
    
    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> sorted(counts.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
    [('N', 22226), ('P', 10845), ('DET', 10648), ('NP', 8336), ('V', 7313), ...]
    >>> [t for t,c in sorted(counts.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)]
    ['N', 'P', 'DET', 'NP', 'V', 'ADJ', ',', '.', 'CNJ', 'PRO', 'ADV', 'VD', ...]

The listing in Figure dictionary_ illustrates an important idiom for sorting a dictionary in terms of its
values, to show the words in decreasing order of frequency.  We use the ``sorted()``
function, with ``key`` and ``reverse`` parameters.  The sort key is the second element of
each pair, which we would normally access using an index ``[1]``.  We can't use this expression
on its own (i.e. ``key=[1]``) since ``[1]`` looks like a list containing the integer 1.
Instead we use ``itemgetter(1)``, a function which does the same thing:

    >>> pair = ('?', 241)
    >>> pair[1]
    241
    >>> itemgetter(1)(pair)
    241

The listing in Figure dictionary_ illustrates an important programming idiom
for working with dictionaries, and we'll give a schematic version here:

|    ``my_dictionary = nltk.defaultdict(``\ *function to create default value*\ ``)``
|    ``for`` *item* ``in`` *sequence*\ ``:``
|        *update* ``my_dictionary[``\ *item_key*\ ``]`` *with information about item*

Here's another example, where we index the words according to their last two letters:

    >>> last_letters = nltk.defaultdict(list)
    >>> words = nltk.corpus.words.words('en')
    >>> for word in words:
    ...     key = word[-2:]
    ...     last_letters[key].append(word)
    ...
    >>> last_letters['ly']
    ['abjectly', 'ably', 'abnormally', 'abortively', 'abruptly', 'absently', 'absolutely',
    'abstractly', 'absurdly', 'abundantly', 'abysmally', 'academically', 'acceptably', ...]
    >>> last_letters['zy']
    ['breezy', 'buzzy', 'cozy', 'crazy', 'dizzy', 'frenzy', 'fuzzy', 'hazy', 'jazzy', ...]

The following example uses the same pattern to create an anagram dictionary.
(You might experiment with the third line to get an idea of why this program works.)

    >>> anagrams = nltk.defaultdict(list)
    >>> for word in words:
    ...     key = ''.join(sorted(word))
    ...     anagrams[key].append(word)
    ...
    >>> anagrams['aegilnrt']
    ['alerting', 'altering', 'integral', 'relating', 'triangle']

.. note:: Since accumulating words like this is such a common task,
   |NLTK| provides a more convenient way of creating a ``defaultdict(list)``:

      >>> anagrams = nltk.Index((''.join(sorted(w)), w) for w in words)

.. note:: ``nltk.FreqDist`` is essentially a ``defaultdict(int)`` with extra
   support for initialization, sorting and plotting that are needed in language processing.
   Similarly ``nltk.Index`` is a ``defaultdict(list)`` with extra support for
   initialization.

We can use default dictionaries with complex keys and values.
Let's study the range of possible tags for a word (a dictionary of counts), given the
word and the tag of the previous word (a tuple consisting of a word and a tag).

    >>> pos = nltk.defaultdict(lambda: nltk.defaultdict(int))
    >>> for ((w1,t1), (w2,t2)) in nltk.bigrams(brown_news_tagged):
    ...     pos[(t1,w2)][t2] += 1
    ...
    >>> for key in pos:
    ...     if len(pos[key]) > 2:
    ...         print key, pos[key]
    ...
    >>> pos[('N', 'that')]
    defaultdict(<type 'int'>, {'V': 10, 'CNJ': 145, 'WH': 112})
    >>> pos[('DET', 'right')]
    defaultdict(<type 'int'>, {'ADV': 3, 'ADJ': 9, 'N': 3})


Inverting a Dictionary
----------------------

Dictionaries support efficient lookup, so long as you want to get the value for
any key.  If ``d`` is a dictionary and ``k`` is a key, we type ``d[k]`` and
immediately obtain the value.  Finding a key given a value is slower and more
cumbersome:

    >>> [key for (key, value) in counts.items() if value == 16]
    ['call', 'sleepe', 'take', 'where', 'Your', 'Father', 'looke', 'owne']

If we expect to do this kind of "reverse lookup" often, it helps to construct
a dictionary that maps values to keys.  In the case that no two keys have
the same value, this is an easy thing to do.  We just get all the key-value
pairs in the dictionary, and create a new dictionary of value-key pairs:

    >>> pos = {'colorless': 'ADJ', 'ideas': 'N', 'sleep': 'V', 'furiously': 'ADV'}
    >>> pos2 = dict((value, key) for (key, value) in pos.items())
    >>> pos2['N']
    'ideas'

Let's make our part-of-speech dictionary a bit more realistic and add some more words,
to create the situation where multiple keys have the same value.  The above method
will not work in this case (why not?).  Instead, we need to use our method of incrementally
updating a dictionary, as follows:

    >>> pos.update({'cats': 'N', 'scratch': 'V', 'peacefully': 'ADV', 'old': 'ADJ'})
    >>> pos2 = {}
    >>> for key, value in pos.items():
    ...     if value not in pos2:
    ...         pos2[value] = []
    ...     pos2[value].append(key)
    ... 
    >>> pos2['ADV']
    ['peacefully', 'furiously']

Now, we have inverted the ``pos`` dictionary, and can look up any part-of-speech and find
all words having that part-of-speech.  We can do the same thing using |NLTK|\ 's support
for indexing as follows:

    >>> pos2 = nltk.Index((value, key) for (key, value) in pos.items())

Summary
-------

Thanks to their versatility, Python dictionaries are extremely useful in most areas of |NLP|.
We already made heavy use of dictionaries in Chapter chap-introduction_, since
|NLTK|\ 's ``FreqDist`` objects are just a special case of dictionaries for counting things.

   Summary of Python's Dictionary Methods



.. _sec-automatic-tagging:

-----------------
Automatic Tagging
-----------------

Automatic tagging has several applications.  We have already
seen an example of how to exploit tags in corpus analysis |mdash| we
get a clear understanding of the distribution of `often`:lx: by
looking at the tags of adjacent words.  Automatic tagging
also helps predict the behavior of previously unseen words.
For example, if we encounter the word
`blogging`:lx: we can probably infer that it is a verb, with
the root `blog`:lx:, and likely to occur after forms of the auxiliary
``to be`` (e.g. `he was blogging`:lx:).  Parts of speech are also used
in speech synthesis and recognition.  For example, ``wind/NN``, as in
`the wind blew`:lx:, is pronounced with a short vowel, whereas
``wind/VB``, as in `to wind the clock`:lx:, is pronounced with a long
vowel.  Other examples can be found where the stress pattern differs
depending on whether the word is a noun or a verb, e.g. `contest`:lx:,
`insult`:lx:, `present`:lx:, `protest`:lx:, `rebel`:lx:, `suspect`:lx:.
Without knowing the part-of-speech we cannot be sure of pronouncing
the word correctly.

In the next section we will see how to access and explore the Brown
Corpus.  Following this we will take a closer look at the
linguistics of word classes.  The rest of the chapter will deal with
automatic tagging: simple taggers, evaluation, and n-gram taggers.

The Default Tagger
------------------

The simplest possible tagger assigns the same tag to each token.  This
may seem to be a rather banal step, but it establishes an important
baseline for tagger performance.  In order to get the best result, we
tag each word with the most likely word.  (This kind of tagger is
known as a `majority class classifier`:dt:).  What then, is the most
frequent tag?  We can find out using a one-line program:

    >>> nltk.FreqDist(tag for (word, tag) in brown_news_tagged).max()
    'NN'

Now we can create a tagger, called ``default_tagger``, that
tags everything as `NN`:gc:.

    >>> raw = 'I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am!'
    >>> tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(raw)
    >>> default_tagger = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')
    >>> default_tagger.tag(tokens)
    [('I', 'NN'), ('do', 'NN'), ('not', 'NN'), ('like', 'NN'), ('green', 'NN'),
    ('eggs', 'NN'), ('and', 'NN'), ('ham', 'NN'), (',', 'NN'), ('I', 'NN'),
    ('do', 'NN'), ('not', 'NN'), ('like', 'NN'), ('them', 'NN'), ('Sam', 'NN'),
    ('I', 'NN'), ('am', 'NN'), ('!', 'NN')]

This method performs poorly when used on its own.
On a typical corpus, it will tag only about an eighth of the tokens correctly:

    >>> brown_news_tagged = brown.tagged_words(categories='news')
    >>> nltk.tag.accuracy(default_tagger, brown_news_tagged)
    0.13089484257215028

Default taggers assign their tag to every single word, even words that
have never been encountered before.  As it happens, most new words are
nouns.  Thus, default taggers help to improve the
robustness of a language processing system.  We will return to them
later, in the context of our discussion of *backoff*.

The Lookup Tagger
-----------------

A lot of high-frequency words do not have the ``NN`` tag.
Let's find some of these words and their tags.  The
following code takes a list of sentences and counts up the words,
and prints the 100 most frequent words:

    >>> brown_news_text = brown.words(categories='news')
    >>> fd = nltk.FreqDist(brown_news_text)
    >>> most_freq_words = fd.keys()[:100]
    >>> most_freq_words
    ['the', ',', '.', 'of', 'and', 'to', 'a', 'in', 'for', 'The', 'that', '``',
    'is', 'was', "''", 'on', 'at', 'with', 'be', 'by', 'as', 'he', 'said', ...]

Next, let's set up a dictionary that maps from each of the 100 most frequent
words to its most likely tag:

    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(brown_news_tagged)
    >>> likely_tags = dict((word, cfd[word].max()) for word in most_freq_words)

Finally, we can create and evaluate a simple tagger that assigns tags to words
based on the ``likely_tags`` dictionary:

    >>> baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model=likely_tags)
    >>> nltk.tag.accuracy(baseline_tagger, brown.tagged_sents(categories='news'))
    0.45578495136941344

This is surprisingly good; just knowing the tags for the 100 most frequent
words enables us to tag nearly half of all words correctly!  Let's see
what it does on some untagged input text:

    >>> baseline_tagger.tag(brown.sents(categories='news')[3])
    [('``', '``'), ('Only', None), ('a', 'AT'), ('relative', None),
    ('handful', None), ('of', 'IN'), ('such', None), ('reports', None), 
    ('was', 'BEDZ'), ('received', None), ("''", "''"), (',', ','),
    ('the', 'AT'), ('jury', None), ('said', 'VBD'), (',', ','), 
    ('``', '``'), ('considering', None), ('the', 'AT'), ('widespread', None), 
    ('interest', None), ('in', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('election', None), 
    (',', ','), ('the', 'AT'), ('number', None), ('of', 'IN'),
    ('voters', None), ('and', 'CC'), ('the', 'AT'), ('size', None),
    ('of', 'IN'), ('this', 'DT'), ('city', None), ("''", "''"), ('.', '.')]

Notice that a lot of these words have been assigned a tag of ``None``.
That is because they were not among the 100 most frequent words.
In these cases we would like to assign the default tag of ``NN``,
a process known as backoff.

Getting Better Coverage with Backoff
------------------------------------

So far the performance of our simple taggers has been disappointing.
Before we embark on a process to get 90+% performance, we need to do
two more things.  First, we need to establish a more principled
baseline performance than the default tagger, which was too
simplistic, and the regular expression tagger, which was too
arbitrary.  Second, we need a way to connect multiple taggers
together, so that if a more specialized tagger is unable to assign
a tag, we can "back off" to a more generalized tagger.

How do we combine these taggers?  We want to use the lookup table
first, and if it is unable to assign a tag, then use the default tagger.
We do this by specifying the default tagger as an argument to the
lookup tagger.  The lookup tagger will invoke the default tagger just
in case it can't assign a tag itself.

    >>> baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model=likely_tags, backoff=nltk.DefaultTagger('NN'))
    >>> nltk.tag.accuracy(baseline_tagger, brown_news_tagged)
    0.58177695566561249

We will return to this technique in the context of a broader discussion
on combining taggers in Section sec-n-gram-tagging_.

We can put all this together to write a simple (but somewhat inefficient) program to create and
evaluate lookup taggers having a range of sizes, as shown in Figure baseline-tagger_.
We include a backoff tagger that tags everything as a noun.  A consequence
of using this backoff tagger is that the lookup tagger only has to store word/tag
pairs for words other than nouns.

.. pylisting:: baseline-tagger
   :caption: Lookup Tagger Performance with Varying Model Size

       lt = dict((word, cfd[word].max()) for word in wordlist)

       return nltk.tag.accuracy(baseline_tagger, brown.tagged_sents(categories='news'))

   def display():

Observe that performance initially increases rapidly as the model size grows, eventually
reaching a plateau, when large increases in model size yield little improvement
in performance.  (This example used the ``pylab`` plotting package; we will
return to this in Section sec-visualization_).

.. _sec-regular-expression-tagging:

--------------------------
Regular Expression Tagging
--------------------------

Some Morphology
---------------

English nouns can be morphologically complex.  For example, words like
`books`:lx: and `women`:lx: are plural.  Words with the `-ness`:lx:
suffix are nouns that have been derived from adjectives,
e.g. `happiness`:lx: and `illness`:lx:.  The `-ment`:lx: suffix
appears on certain nouns derived from verbs, e.g. `government`:lx: and
`establishment`:lx:.

English verbs can also be morphologically complex.  For instance, the
`present participle`:dt: of a verb ends in `-ing`:lx:, and expresses
the idea of ongoing, incomplete action (e.g. `falling`:lx:, `eating`:lx:).
The `-ing`:lx: suffix also appears on nouns derived from verbs, e.g. `the
falling of the leaves`:lx: (this is known as the `gerund`:dt:).
In the Brown corpus, these are tagged `VBG`:gc:.

The `past participle`:dt: of a verb often ends in `-ed`:lx:, and
expresses the idea of a completed action (e.g. `walked`:lx:, `cried`:lx:).
These are tagged `VBD`:gc:.

.. TODO: Modal verbs, e.g. `would`:lx: ...

Common tag sets often capture some `morpho-syntactic`:dt: information;
that is, information about the kind of morphological markings that
words receive by virtue of their syntactic role.  Consider, for
example, the selection of distinct grammatical forms of the word
`go`:lx: illustrated in the following sentences:

.. _go:
.. ex::
  .. ex:: *Go* away!
  .. ex::  He sometimes *goes* to the cafe.
  .. ex::  All the cakes have *gone*.
  .. ex::  We *went* on the excursion.

Each of these forms |mdash| `go`:lx:, `goes`:lx:, `gone`:lx:, and `went`:lx: |mdash|
is morphologically distinct from the others. Consider the form,
`goes`:lx:. This cannot occur in all grammatical contexts, but
requires, for instance, a third person singular subject. Thus, the
following sentences are ungrammatical.

.. ex::
  .. ex:: \*They sometimes *goes* to the cafe.
  .. ex:: \*I sometimes *goes* to the cafe.

By contrast, `gone`:lx: is the past participle form; it is required
after `have`:lx: (and cannot be replaced in this context by
`goes`:lx:), and cannot occur as the main verb of a clause. 

.. ex::
  .. ex:: \*All the cakes have *goes*.
  .. ex:: \*He sometimes *gone* to the cafe.

We can easily imagine a tag set in which the four distinct
grammatical forms just discussed were all tagged as `VB`:gc:. Although
this would be adequate for some purposes, a more fine-grained tag set
will provide useful information about these forms that can be of value
to other processors that try to detect syntactic patterns from tag
sequences. As we noted at the beginning of this chapter,
the Brown tag set does in fact capture these distinctions,
as summarized in Table morphosyntax_.

   Some morphosyntactic distinctions in the Brown tag set

In addition to this set of verb tags, the various forms of the verb `to be`:lx:
have special tags:   
``be/BE, being/BEG, am/BEM, been/BEN`` and ``was/BEDZ``.   All told,
this fine-grained tagging of verbs means that an automatic tagger
that uses this tag set is in effect carrying out a limited amount
of morphological analysis.

Most part-of-speech tag sets make use of the same basic categories,
such as noun, verb, adjective, and preposition. However, tag sets
differ both in how finely they divide words into categories, and in
how they define their categories. For example, `is`:lx: might be tagged
simply as a verb in one tag set; but as a distinct form of the lexeme `BE`:lx:
in another tag set (as in the Brown Corpus).  This variation in tag sets is
unavoidable, since part-of-speech tags are used in different ways for
different tasks. In other words, there is no one 'right way' to assign
tags, only more or less useful ways depending on one's goals.

.. More details about the Brown corpus tag set can be found in the `Appendix`_
   at the end of this chapter.

The Regular Expression Tagger
-----------------------------

The regular expression tagger assigns tags to tokens on the basis of
matching patterns.  For instance, we might guess that any word ending
in `ed`:lx: is the past participle of a verb, and any word ending with
`'s`:lx: is a possessive noun.  We can express these as a list of
regular expressions:

    >>> patterns = [
    ...     (r'.*ing$', 'VBG'),               # gerunds
    ...     (r'.*ed$', 'VBD'),                # simple past
    ...     (r'.*es$', 'VBZ'),                # 3rd singular present
    ...     (r'.*ould$', 'MD'),               # modals
    ...     (r'.*\'s$', 'NN$'),               # possessive nouns
    ...     (r'.*s$', 'NNS'),                 # plural nouns
    ...     (r'^-?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?$', 'CD'),  # cardinal numbers
    ...     (r'.*', 'NN')                     # nouns (default)
    ... ]

Note that these are processed in order, and the first one that matches is applied.

Now we can set up a tagger and use it to tag some text.

    >>> regexp_tagger = nltk.RegexpTagger(patterns)
    >>> regexp_tagger.tag(brown.sents(categories='news')[3])
    [('``', 'NN'), ('Only', 'NN'), ('a', 'NN'), ('relative', 'NN'),
    ('handful', 'NN'), ('of', 'NN'), ('such', 'NN'), ('reports', 'NNS'), 
    ('was', 'NNS'), ('received', 'VBD'), ("''", 'NN'), (',', 'NN'),
    ('the', 'NN'), ('jury', 'NN'), ('said', 'NN'), (',', 'NN'), ('``', 'NN'),
    ('considering', 'VBG'), ('the', 'NN'), ('widespread', 'NN'), ..., ('.', 'NN')]

How well does this do?

    >>> nltk.tag.accuracy(regexp_tagger, brown.tagged_sents(categories='news'))
    0.20326391789486245

The final regular expression |l|\ ``.*``\ |r| is a catch-all that tags everything as a noun.
This is equivalent to the default tagger (only much less efficient).
Instead of re-specifying this as part of the regular expression tagger,
is there a way to combine this tagger with the default tagger?  We
will see how to do this later, under the heading of backoff taggers.


Affix Taggers
-------------

Affix taggers are like unigram taggers, except they are trained on
word prefixes or suffixes of a specified length.  (NB. Here we use
*prefix* and *suffix* in the string sense, not the morphological
sense.)  For example, the following tagger will consider suffixes of
length 3 (e.g. *-ize*, *-ion*), for words having at least 5
characters.

    >>> affix_tagger = nltk.AffixTagger(brown.tagged_sents(categories='news'),
    ...                     affix_length=-2, min_stem_length=3)
    >>> affix_tagger.tag(sent)
    [('Various', 'JJ'), ('of', None), ('the', None), ('apartments', 'NNS'), ('are', None),
    ('of', None), ('the', None), ('terrace', 'NN'), ('type', None), (',', None),
    ('being', 'VBG'), ('on', None), ('the', None), ('ground', 'NN'), ('floor', 'NN'),
    ('so', None), ('that', None), ('entrance', 'NN'), ('is', None), ('direct', 'NN'),
    ('.', None)]

N-Gram Tagging
--------------

Unigram Tagging
---------------

Unigram taggers are based on a simple statistical algorithm:
for each token, assign the tag that is most likely for
that particular token. For example, it will assign the tag ``JJ`` to any
occurrence of the word `frequent`:lx:, since `frequent`:lx: is used as an
adjective (e.g. `a frequent word`:lx:) more often than it is used as a
verb (e.g. `I frequent this cafe`:lx:).
A unigram tagger behaves just like a lookup tagger (Section sec-automatic-tagging_),
except there is a more convenient technique for setting it up,
called `training`:dt:\ .  In the following code sample,
we initialize and train a unigram tagger (line tag-train_),
use it to tag a sentence, then finally compute the tagger's overall accuracy:

    >>> brown_news = brown.tagged_sents(categories='news')
    >>> unigram_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(brown_news)               # [_tag-train]
    >>> sent = brown.sents(categories='news')[2007]
    >>> unigram_tagger.tag(sent)
    [('Various', None), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('apartments', 'NNS'), ('are', 'BER'),
    ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('terrace', 'NN'), ('type', 'NN'), (',', ','),
    ('being', 'BEG'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('ground', 'NN'), ('floor', 'NN'),
    ('so', 'QL'), ('that', 'CS'), ('entrance', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'), ('direct', 'JJ'), ('.', '.')]
    >>> nltk.tag.accuracy(unigram_tagger, brown_news)
    0.8550331165343994


N-Gram Tagging
--------------

When we perform a language processing task based on unigrams, we are using
one item of context.  In the case of tagging, we only consider the current
token, in isolation from any larger context.  Given such a model, the best
we can do is tag each word with its *a priori* most likely tag.
This means we would tag a word such as `wind`:lx: with the same tag,
regardless of whether it appears in the context `the wind`:lx: or
`to wind`:lx:\ .

An `n-gram tagger`:dt: is a generalization of a unigram tagger whose context is
the current word together with the part-of-speech tags of the
*n-1* preceding tokens, as shown in Figure fig-tag-context_. The tag to be
chosen, *t*\ `n`:subscript:, is circled, and the context is shaded
in grey. In the example of an n-gram tagger shown in Figure fig-tag-context_,
we have *n=3*; that is, we consider the tags of the two preceding words in addition
to the current word.  An n-gram tagger
picks the tag that is most likely in the given context. 

.. _fig-tag-context:
.. figure:: ../images/tag-context.png
   :scale: 80

   Tagger Context

.. note:: A 1-gram tagger is another term for a unigram tagger: i.e.,
   the context used to tag a token is just the text of the token itself.
   2-gram taggers are also called *bigram taggers*, and 3-gram taggers
   are called *trigram taggers*.

The ``NgramTagger`` class uses a tagged training corpus to determine which
part-of-speech tag is most likely for each context.  Here we see
a special case of an n-gram tagger, namely a bigram tagger.
First we train it, then use it to tag untagged sentences:

    >>> bigram_tagger = nltk.BigramTagger(brown_news, cutoff=0)
    >>> bigram_tagger.tag(sent)
    [('Various', 'JJ'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('apartments', 'NNS'), ('are', 'BER'),
    ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('terrace', 'NN'), ('type', 'NN'), (',', ','),
    ('being', 'BEG'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('ground', 'NN'), ('floor', 'NN'),
    ('so', 'CS'), ('that', 'CS'), ('entrance', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'), ('direct', 'JJ'),
    ('.', '.')]

As with the other taggers, n-gram taggers assign the tag `None`:gc: to
any token whose context was not seen during training.

As *n* gets larger, the specificity of the contexts increases,
as does the chance that the data we wish to tag contains contexts that
were not present in the training data. This is known as the *sparse
data* problem, and is quite pervasive in NLP. Thus, there is a
trade-off between the accuracy and the coverage of our results (and
this is related to the `precision/recall trade-off`:dt: in information
retrieval).

.. Note:: n-gram taggers should not consider context that crosses a
   sentence boundary.  Accordingly, NLTK taggers are designed to work
   with lists of sentences, where each sentence is a list of words.  At
   the start of a sentence, *t*\ `n-1`:subscript: and preceding
   tags are set to ``None``.

Combining Taggers
-----------------

One way to address the trade-off between accuracy and coverage is to
use the more accurate algorithms when we can, but to fall back on
algorithms with wider coverage when necessary. For example, we could
combine the results of a bigram tagger, a unigram tagger, and
a ``regexp_tagger``, as follows:

1. Try tagging the token with the bigram tagger.
2. If the bigram tagger is unable to find a tag for the token, try
   the unigram tagger.
3. If the unigram tagger is also unable to find a tag, use a default tagger.

Most NLTK taggers permit a backoff-tagger to be specified.
The backoff-tagger may itself have a backoff tagger:

    >>> t0 = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')
    >>> t1 = nltk.UnigramTagger(brown_news, backoff=t0)
    >>> t2 = nltk.BigramTagger(brown_news, backoff=t1)
    >>> nltk.tag.accuracy(t2, brown_news)
    0.88565347972233821

.. Note:: We specify the backoff tagger when the tagger is
   initialized, so that training can take advantage of the backoff tagger.
   Thus, if the bigram tagger would assign
   the same tag as its unigram backoff tagger in
   a certain context, the bigram tagger discards the training instance.
   This keeps the bigram tagger model as small as possible.  We can
   further specify that a tagger needs to see more than one instance of a
   context in order to retain it, e.g. ``nltk.BigramTagger(sents, cutoff=2, backoff=t1)``
   will discard contexts that have only been seen once or twice.

Tagging Unknown Words
---------------------

Our approach to tagging unknown words still uses backoff to a regular-expression tagger
or a default tagger.  These are unable to make use of context.  Thus, if our tagger
encountered the word `blog`:lx:, not seen during training, it would assign it a tag
regardless of whether this word appeared in the context `the blog`:lx: or `to blog`:lx:.
How can we do better with these unknown words, or `out-of-vocabulary`:dt: items?

A useful method to tag unknown words based on context is to limit the vocabulary
of a tagger to the most frequent `n`:math: words, and to replace every other word
with a special word `UNK`:lx:\ .  During training, a unigram tagger will probably
learn that this "word" is usually a noun.  However, the n-gram taggers will
detect contexts in which it has some other tag.  For example, if the
preceding word is `to`:lx: (tagged ``TO``), then `UNK`:lx: will probably
be tagged as a verb.  Full exploration of this method is left to the exercises.

Storing Taggers
---------------

Training a tagger on a large corpus may take several minutes.  Instead of training a tagger
every time we need one, it is convenient to save a trained tagger in a file for later re-use.
Let's save our tagger ``t2`` to a file ``t2.pkl``.

    >>> from cPickle import dump
    >>> output = open('t2.pkl', 'wb')
    >>> dump(t2, output, -1)
    >>> output.close()

Now, in a separate Python process, we can load our saved tagger.

    >>> from cPickle import load
    >>> input = open('t2.pkl', 'rb')
    >>> tagger = load(input)
    >>> input.close()

Now let's check that it can be used for tagging.

    >>> text = """The board's action shows what free enterprise
    ...     is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws ."""
    >>> tokens = text.split()
    >>> tagger.tag(tokens)
    [('The', 'AT'), ("board's", 'NN$'), ('action', 'NN'), ('shows', 'NNS'),
    ('what', 'WDT'), ('free', 'JJ'), ('enterprise', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'),
    ('up', 'RP'), ('against', 'IN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('our', 'PP$'), ('complex', 'JJ'),
    ('maze', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('regulatory', 'NN'), ('laws', 'NNS'), ('.', '.')]

Performance Limitations
-----------------------

What is the upper limit to the performance of an n-gram tagger?
Consider the case of a trigram tagger.  How many cases of part-of-speech ambiguity does it
encounter?  We can determine the answer to this question empirically:

    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...            ((x[1], y[1], z[0]), z[1])
    ...            for sent in brown.tagged_sents(categories='news')
    ...            for x, y, z in nltk.trigrams(sent))
    >>> ambiguous_contexts = [c for c in cfd.conditions() if len(cfd[c]) > 1]
    >>> sum(cfd[c].N() for c in ambiguous_contexts) / float(cfd.N())
    0.049297702067999993

Thus, one out of twenty trigrams is ambiguous.  Given the
current word and the previous two tags, in 5% of cases there is more than one tag
that could be legitimately assigned to the current word according to
the training data.  Assuming we always pick the most likely tag in
such ambiguous contexts, we can derive an empirical upper bound on
the performance of a trigram tagger.

Another way to investigate the performance of a tagger is to study
its mistakes.  Some tags may be harder than others to assign, and
it might be possible to treat them specially by pre- or post-processing
the data.  A convenient way to look at tagging errors is the
`confusion matrix`:dt:.  It charts expected tags (the gold standard)
against actual tags generated by a tagger:

    >>> def tag_list(tagged_sents):
    ...     return [tag for sent in tagged_sents for (word, tag) in sent]
    >>> def apply_tagger(tagger, corpus):
    ...     return [tagger.tag(tag.untag(sent)) for sent in corpus]
    >>> gold = tag_list(brown.tagged_sents(categories='editorial'))
    >>> test = tag_list(apply_tagger(t2, brown.tagged_sents(categories='editorial')))
    >>> print nltk.ConfusionMatrix(gold, test)                # doctest: +SKIP

Based on such analysis we may decide to modify the tagset.  Perhaps
a distinction between tags that is difficult to make can be dropped,
since it is not important in the context of some larger processing task.

In general, observe that the tagging process simultaneously collapses distinctions
(i.e., lexical identity is usually lost when all personal pronouns are
tagged `prp`:gc:), while introducing distinctions and removing
ambiguities (e.g. `deal`:lx: tagged as `vb`:gc: or `nn`:gc:).  This move
facilitates classification and prediction.
When we introduce finer distinctions in a tag set, we get better information
about linguistic context, but we have to do more work to classify the
current token (there are more tags to choose from).  Conversely, with
fewer distinctions (as with the simplified tagset), we have less work
to do for classifying the current token,
but less information about the context to draw on.

We have seen that ambiguity in the training data leads to an upper limit
in tagger performance.  Sometimes more context will resolve the
ambiguity.  In other cases however, as noted by [Abney1996PST]_, the
ambiguity can only be resolved with reference to syntax, or to world
knowledge.  Despite these imperfections, part-of-speech tagging has
played a central role in the rise of statistical approaches to natural
language processing.  In the early 1990s, the surprising accuracy of
statistical taggers was a striking demonstration that it was possible
to solve one small part of the language understanding problem, namely
part-of-speech disambiguation, without reference to deeper sources of
linguistic knowledge.  Can this idea be pushed further?  In Chapter chap-chunk_,
on chunk parsing, we shall see that it can.

----------------------------
Transformation-Based Tagging
----------------------------

A potential issue with n-gram taggers is the size of their n-gram
table (or language model).  If tagging is to be employed in a variety
of language technologies deployed on mobile computing devices, it is
important to strike a balance between model size and tagger
performance.  An n-gram tagger with backoff may store trigram and
bigram tables, large sparse arrays which may have hundreds of millions
of entries.

A second issue concerns context.  The only information an n-gram
tagger considers from prior context is tags, even though words
themselves might be a useful source of information.  It is simply
impractical for n-gram models to be conditioned on the identities of
words in the context.  In this section we examine Brill tagging,
a statistical tagging method which performs very well using models
that are only a tiny fraction of the size of n-gram taggers.

Brill Tagging
-------------

Brill tagging is a kind of *transformation-based learning*, named
after its inventor [REF].  The
general idea is very simple: guess the tag of each word, then go back
and fix the mistakes.  In this way, a Brill tagger successively
transforms a bad tagging of a text into a better one.  As with n-gram
tagging, this is a *supervised learning* method, since we need
annotated training data.  However, unlike n-gram tagging, it does
not count observations but compiles a list of transformational
correction rules.

The process of Brill tagging is usually explained by analogy with
painting.  Suppose we were painting a tree, with all its details of
boughs, branches, twigs and leaves, against a uniform sky-blue
background.  Instead of painting the tree first then trying to paint
blue in the gaps, it is simpler to paint the whole canvas blue, then
"correct" the tree section by over-painting the blue background.  In
the same fashion we might paint the trunk a uniform brown before going
back to over-paint further details with even finer brushes.  Brill
tagging uses the same idea: begin with broad brush strokes then fix up
the details, with successively finer changes.  Table brill-tagging_
illustrates this process, first tagging with the unigram tagger, then
fixing the errors.

   Steps in Brill Tagging
 
In this table we see two rules.  All such rules are generated from a
template of the following form: form "replace *T*\ :subscript:`1` with
*T*\ :subscript:`2` in the context *C*".  Typical contexts are the
identity or the tag of the preceding or following word, or the
appearance of a specific tag within 2-3 words of of the current word.  During
its training phase, the tagger guesses values for *T*\ :subscript:`1`,
*T*\ :subscript:`2` and *C*, to create thousands of candidate rules.
Each rule is scored according to its net benefit: the
number of incorrect tags that it corrects, less the number of correct
tags it incorrectly modifies.

Brill taggers have another interesting property: the rules are
linguistically interpretable.  Compare this with the n-gram taggers,
which employ a potentially massive table of n-grams.  We cannot learn
much from direct inspection of such a table, in comparison to the
rules learned by the Brill tagger.

---------------------------------------
How to Determine the Category of a Word
---------------------------------------

Now that we have examined word classes in detail, we turn to a more
basic question: how do we decide what category a word belongs to in
the first place? In general, linguists use three criteria:
morphological (or formal); syntactic (or distributional); semantic (or
notional).  A `morphological`:dt: criterion is one that looks at the
internal structure of a word. For example, `-ness`:lx: is a suffix
that combines with an adjective to produce a noun. Examples are
`happy`:lx: |rarr| `happiness`:lx:, `ill`:lx: |rarr| `illness`:lx:. So
if we encounter a word that ends in `-ness`:lx:, this is very likely
to be a noun.

A `syntactic`:dt: criterion refers to the contexts in which a word can
occur. For example, assume that we have already determined the
category of nouns. Then we might say that a syntactic criterion for an
adjective in English is that it can occur immediately before a noun,
or immediately following the words `be`:lx: or `very`:lx:. According
to these tests, `near`:lx: should be categorized as an adjective:

.. ex::
   .. ex:: the near window
   .. ex:: The end is (very) near.

A familiar example of a `semantic`:dt: criterion is that a noun is
"the name of a person, place or thing". Within modern linguistics,
semantic criteria for word classes are treated with suspicion, mainly
because they are hard to formalize. Nevertheless, semantic criteria
underpin many of our intuitions about word classes, and enable us to
make a good guess about the categorization of words in languages that
we are unfamiliar with.  For example, if we all we know about the Dutch
`verjaardag`:lx: is that it means the same as the English word
`birthday`:lx:, then we can guess that `verjaardag`:lx: is a noun in
Dutch. However, some care is needed: although we might translate `zij
is vandaag jarig`:lx: as `it's her birthday today`:lx:, the word
`jarig`:lx: is in fact an adjective in Dutch, and has no exact
equivalent in English!

All languages acquire new lexical items. A list of words recently
added to the Oxford Dictionary of English includes `cyberslacker,
fatoush, blamestorm, SARS, cantopop, bupkis, noughties, muggle`:lx:, and
`robata`:lx:. Notice that all these new words are nouns, and this is
reflected in calling nouns an `open class`. By contrast, prepositions
are regarded as a `closed class`:dt:. That is, there is a limited set of
words belonging to the class (e.g., `above, along, at, below, beside,
between, during, for, from, in, near, on, outside, over, past,
through, towards, under, up, with`:lx:), and membership of the set only
changes very gradually over time.

Summary
-------

* Words can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
  These classes are known as lexical categories or parts of speech.
  Parts of speech are assigned short labels, or tags, such as ``NN``, ``VB``,

* The process of automatically assigning parts of speech to words in text
  is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.

* Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.

* A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g.
  default tagger, regular expression tagger, unigram tagger and n-gram taggers.
  These can be combined using a technique known as backoff.

* Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.

* Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence
  classification task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point
  in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the local context.

* A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information,
  such as a string and a number: ``freq['cat'] = 12``.  We create
  dictionaries using the brace notation: ``pos = {}``,
  ``pos = {'furiously': 'adv', 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}``.

For more examples of tagging with |NLTK|, please see the
guide at ``http://nltk.org/doc/guides/tag.html``.
Chapters 4 and 5 of [JurafskyMartin2008]_ contain more advanced
material on n-grams and part-of-speech tagging.

There are several other important approaches to tagging involving
*Transformation-Based Learning*, *Markov Modeling*, and *Finite State
Methods*.  (We will discuss some of these in Chapter chap-data-intensive_.)
In Chapter chap-chunk_ we will see a generalization of tagging called *chunking* in which a
contiguous sequence of words is assigned a single tag.

Part-of-speech tagging is just one kind of tagging, one that
does not depend on deep linguistic analysis.
There are many other kinds of tagging.  Words
can be tagged with directives to a speech synthesizer, indicating
which words should be emphasized.  Words can be tagged with sense
numbers, indicating which sense of the word was used.  Words can also
be tagged with morphological features.
Examples of each of these kinds of tags are shown below.
For space reasons, we only show the tag for a single
word. Note also that the first two examples use XML-style
tags, where elements in angle brackets enclose the word that is
tagged.

1. *Speech Synthesis Markup Language (W3C SSML):*
   ``That is a <emphasis>big</emphasis> car!``
#. *SemCor: Brown Corpus tagged with WordNet senses:*
   ``Space in any <wf pos="NN" lemma="form" wnsn="4">form</wf>
   is completely measured by the three dimensions.``
   (Wordnet form/nn sense 4: "shape, form, configuration,
   contour, conformation")
#. *Morphological tagging, from the Turin University Italian Treebank:*
   ``E' italiano , come progetto e realizzazione , il
   primo (PRIMO ADJ ORDIN M SING) porto turistico dell' Albania .``

Tagging exhibits several properties that are characteristic of natural
language processing.  First, tagging involves *classification*: words have
properties; many words share the same property (e.g. ``cat`` and ``dog``
are both nouns), while some words can have multiple such properties
(e.g. ``wind`` is a noun and a verb).  Second, in tagging, disambiguation
occurs via *representation*: we augment the representation of tokens with
part-of-speech tags.  Third, training a tagger involves *sequence learning
from annotated corpora*.  Finally, tagging uses *simple, general, methods*
such as conditional frequency distributions and transformation-based learning.

Note that tagging is also performed at higher levels.  Here is an example
of dialogue act tagging, from the NPS Chat Corpus [Forsyth2007]_, included with
NLTK.

|   Statement  User117 Dude..., I wanted some of that
|   ynQuestion User120 m I missing something?
|   Bye        User117 I'm gonna go fix food, I'll be back later.
|   System     User122 JOIN
|   System     User2   slaps User122 around a bit with a large trout.
|   Statement  User121 18/m pm me if u tryin to chat

Exercises
---------

#. |easy|
   Search the web for "spoof newspaper headlines", to find such gems as:
   `British Left Waffles on Falkland Islands`:lx:, and
   `Juvenile Court to Try Shooting Defendant`:lx:.
   Manually tag these headlines to see if knowledge of the part-of-speech
   tags removes the ambiguity.

#. |easy|
   Working with someone else, take turns to pick a word that can be
   either a noun or a verb (e.g. `contest`:lx:); the opponent has to
   predict which one is likely to be the most frequent in the Brown corpus; check the
   opponent's prediction, and tally the score over several turns.

#. |soso| Write programs to process the Brown Corpus and find answers to the following
   questions:

   #) Which nouns are more common in their plural form, rather than their singular
      form? (Only consider regular plurals, formed with the `-s`:lx: suffix.)
   #) Which word has the greatest number of distinct tags.  What are they, and
      what do they represent?
   #) List tags in order of decreasing frequency.  What do the 20 most frequent tags represent?
   #) Which tags are nouns most commonly found after?  What do these tags represent?

#. |soso| Explore the following issues that arise in connection with the lookup tagger:

   a) What happens to the tagger performance for the various
      model sizes when a backoff tagger is omitted?
   b) Consider the curve in Figure fig-tag-lookup_; suggest a
      good size for a lookup tagger that balances memory and performance.
      Can you come up with scenarios where it would be preferable to
      minimize memory usage, or to maximize performance with no regard for memory usage?

#. |soso| What is the upper limit of performance for a lookup tagger,
   assuming no limit to the size of its table?  (Hint: write a program
   to work out what percentage of tokens of a word are assigned
   the most likely tag for that word, on average.)

#. |soso| Generate some statistics for tagged data to answer the following questions:

   a)  What proportion of word types are always assigned the same part-of-speech tag?
   #)  How many words are ambiguous, in the sense that they appear with at least two tags?
   #)  What percentage of word *occurrences* in the Brown Corpus involve
       these ambiguous words?

#. |soso| Above we gave an example of the ``nltk.tag.accuracy()`` function.  It has two
   arguments, a tagger and some tagged text, and it works out how accurately
   the tagger performs on this text.  For example, if the supplied tagged text
   was ``[('the', 'DT'), ('dog', 'NN')]`` and the tagger produced the output
   ``[('the', 'NN'), ('dog', 'NN')]``, then the accuracy score would be ``0.5``.
   Can you figure out how the ``nltk.tag.accuracy()`` function works?

   a) A tagger takes a list of words as input, and produces a list of tagged words
      as output.  However, ``nltk.tag.accuracy()`` is given correctly tagged text as its input.
      What must the ``nltk.tag.accuracy()`` function do with this input before performing the tagging?
   b) Once the supplied tagger has created newly tagged text, how would ``nltk.tag.accuracy()``
      go about comparing it with the original tagged text and computing the accuracy score?

#. |easy| Satisfy yourself that there are
   restrictions on the distribution of `go`:lx: and `went`:lx:, in the
   sense that they cannot be freely interchanged in the kinds of contexts
   illustrated in go_.

#. |soso| Write code to search the Brown Corpus for particular words and phrases
   according to tags, to answer the following questions:

   a)  Produce an alphabetically sorted list of the distinct words tagged as ``MD``.
   #)  Identify words that can be plural nouns or third person singular verbs
       (e.g. `deals`:lx:, `flies`:lx:).
   #)  Identify three-word prepositional phrases of the form IN + DET + NN
       (eg. `in the lab`:lx:).
   #)  What is the ratio of masculine to feminine pronouns?

#. |soso| In the introduction we saw a table involving frequency counts for
   the verbs `adore`:lx:, `love`:lx:, `like`:lx:, `prefer`:lx: and
   preceding qualifiers such as `really`:lx:.  Investigate the full
   range of qualifiers (Brown tag `QL`:gc:) that appear before these
   four verbs.

#. |soso|
   We defined the ``regexp_tagger`` that can be used
   as a fall-back tagger for unknown words.  This tagger only checks for
   cardinal numbers.  By testing for particular prefix or suffix strings,
   it should be possible to guess other tags.  For example, 
   we could tag any word that ends with `-s`:lx: as a plural noun.
   Define a regular expression tagger (using ``nltk.RegexpTagger``)
   that tests for at least five other patterns in the spelling of words.
   (Use inline documentation to explain the rules.)

#. |soso|
   Consider the regular expression tagger developed in the exercises in
   the previous section.  Evaluate the tagger using ``nltk.tag.accuracy()``,
   and try to come up with ways to improve its performance.  Discuss your findings.
   How does objective evaluation help in the development process?

#. |hard| There are 264 distinct words in the Brown Corpus having exactly
   three possible tags.

   a)  Print a table with the integers 1..10 in one column, and the
       number of distinct words in the corpus having 1..10 distinct tags
       in the other column.
   #)  For the word with the greatest number of distinct tags, print
       out sentences from the corpus containing the word, one for each
       possible tag.

#. |hard| Write a program to classify contexts involving the word `must`:lx: according
   to the tag of the following word.  Can this be used to discriminate between the
   epistemic and deontic uses of `must`:lx:?

#. |easy|
   Train a unigram tagger and run it on some new text.
   Observe that some words are not assigned a tag.  Why not?

#. |easy|
   Train an affix tagger ``AffixTagger()`` and run it on some new text.
   Experiment with different settings for the affix length
   and the minimum word length.  Can you find a setting that seems
   to perform better than the one described above?  Discuss your findings.

#. |easy|
   Train a bigram tagger with no backoff tagger, and run it on some of the training
   data.  Next, run it on some new data.
   What happens to the performance of the tagger?  Why?

#. |soso|
   Write a program that calls ``AffixTagger()`` repeatedly, using
   different settings for the affix length and the minimum word length.
   What parameter values give the best overall performance?  Why do
   you think this is the case?

#. |soso|
   How serious is the sparse data problem?  Investigate the
   performance of n-gram taggers as `n`:math: increases from 1 to 6.
   Tabulate the accuracy score.  Estimate the training data required
   for these taggers, assuming a vocabulary size of
   10\ `5`:superscript: and a tagset size of 10\ `2`:superscript:.

#. |soso| Obtain some tagged data for another language, and train and
   evaluate a variety of taggers on it.  If the language is
   morphologically complex, or if there are any orthographic clues
   (e.g. capitalization) to word classes, consider developing a
   regular expression tagger for it (ordered after the unigram
   tagger, and before the default tagger).  How does the accuracy of
   your tagger(s) compare with the same taggers run on English data?
   Discuss any issues you encounter in applying these methods to the language.

#. |soso|
   Inspect the confusion matrix for the bigram tagger ``t2`` defined in Section sec-n-gram-tagging_,
   and identify one or more sets of tags to collapse.  Define a dictionary to do
   the mapping, and evaluate the tagger on the simplified data.

#. |soso|
   Experiment with taggers using the simplified tagset (or make one of your
   own by discarding all but the first character of each tag name).
   Such a tagger has fewer distinctions to make, but much less
   information on which to base its work.  Discuss your findings.

#. |hard|
   Create a default tagger and various unigram and n-gram taggers,
   incorporating backoff, and train them on part of the Brown corpus.

   a) Create three different combinations of the taggers. Test the
      accuracy of each combined tagger. Which combination works best?
   #) Try varying the size of the training corpus. How does it affect
      your results?

#. |hard|
   Our approach for tagging an unknown word has been to consider the letters of the word
   (using ``RegexpTagger()`` and ``AffixTagger()``), or to ignore the word altogether and tag
   it as a noun (using ``nltk.DefaultTagger()``).  These methods will not do well for texts having
   new words that are not nouns.
   Consider the sentence `I like to blog on Kim's blog`:lx:.  If `blog`:lx: is a new
   word, then looking at the previous tag (``TO`` vs ``NP$``) would probably be helpful.
   I.e. we need a default tagger that is sensitive to the preceding tag.

   a) Create a new kind of unigram tagger that looks at the tag of the previous word,
      and ignores the current word.  (The best way to do this is to modify the source
      code for ``UnigramTagger()``, which presumes knowledge of Python classes discussed
      in Section OO_.)
   b) Add this tagger to the sequence of backoff taggers (including ordinary trigram
      and bigram taggers that look at words), right before the usual default tagger.
   c) Evaluate the contribution of this new unigram tagger.

#. |hard|
   Write code to preprocess tagged training data, replacing all but the most frequent
   `n`:math: words with the special word `UNK`:lx:.  Train an n-gram backoff tagger
   on this data, then use it to tag some new text.  Note that you will have
   to preprocess the text to replace unknown words with `UNK`:lx:, and post-process
   the tagged output to replace the `UNK`:lx: words with the words from the original
   input.

#. |hard|
   Consider the code in sec-n-gram-tagging_ which
   determines the upper bound for accuracy of a trigram tagger.
   Consult the Abney reading and review his discussion of the
   impossibility of exact tagging.  Explain why correct tagging of
   these examples requires access to other kinds of information than
   just words and tags.  How might you estimate the scale of this problem?
   
#. |hard|
   Use some of the estimation techniques in ``nltk.probability``,
   such as *Lidstone* or *Laplace* estimation, to develop a statistical
   tagger that does a better job than ngram backoff taggers in cases where
   contexts encountered during testing were not seen during training.

#. |soso|
   Consult the documentation for the Brill tagger demo function,
   using ``help(nltk.tag.brill.demo)``.
   Experiment with the tagger by setting different values for the parameters.
   Is there any trade-off between training time (corpus size) and performance?

#. |hard|
   Inspect the diagnostic files created by the tagger ``rules.out`` and
   ``errors.out``.  Obtain the demonstration code (``http://nltk.org/nltk/tag/brill.py``)
   and create your own version of the Brill tagger.
   Delete some of the rule templates, based on what you learned from inspecting ``rules.out``.
   Add some new rule templates which employ contexts that might help to
   correct the errors you saw in ``errors.out``.
