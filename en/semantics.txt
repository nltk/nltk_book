12. Semantic Interpretation
===========================

--------------
 Introduction
--------------

There are many |NLP| applications where it would be useful to have some
representation of the `meaning`:em: of a natural language
sentence. For instance, as
we pointed out in the chapter `Introduction to Natural Language
Processing <introduction.html>`_, current search engine technology
can only take us so far in giving concise and correct answers to many
questions that we might be interested in. Admittedly, Google does a
good job in answering g1a_, since its first hit is g1b_.

.. _g1:
.. ex::
      
      .. _g1a:
      .. ex:: What is the population of Saudi Arabia?

      .. _g1b:
      .. ex:: Saudi Arabia - Population: 26,417,599

By contrast, the result of sending g2_ to Google is less helpful:

.. _g2:
.. ex:: Which countries border the Mediterranean?

This time, the topmost hit (and the only relevant one in the top ten)
presents the relevant information as a map of the Mediterranean
basin. Since the map is an image file, it is not easy to
extractthe required list of countries from the returned page.
Even if Google succeeds in finding documents which contain information
relevant to our question, there is no guarantee that it will be in a
form which can be easily converted into an appropriate answer. One
reason for this is that the information may have to be inferred from more
than one source. This is likely to be the case when we seek an answer
to more complex questions like g3_:

.. _g3:
.. ex:: Which countries bordering the Mediterranean border Asian
        countries?

Here, we would probably need to combine the results of two subqueries, 
namely g2_ and `Which countries border Asian countries`:lx:.
The examples we have just provide are drawn from a paper dating back
to 1982 (Warren and Pereira). This develops a framework for converting
natural language questions into a semantic representation, and using
the latter to retrieve answers from a knowledge base. For the time
being, let's leave open the format of such knowledge bases, and
just assume that structured information is indeed available and can
be interrogated by a suitable query language. Then the challenge for
|NLP| is how to find a reasonably general method for converting
natural language questions into the target query language. An
alternative paradigm for question answering is to take Google hits as
a starting point and then to carry out further analysis and processing
of the textual information present in the returned pages. In either
case, we need to be able to build semantic representations of sentences.

..
   The |NLP| challenge that we have just discussed intersects with one of
   the key goals of linguistic theory, namely to provide a systematic
   correspondence between form and meaning.  

A widely adopted approach to representing meaning |mdash| or at least,
some aspects of meaning |mdash| involves translating expressions of
natural language into |fol| (|FOL|). From a computational point of
view, a strong argument in favour of |FOL| is that it strikes a
reasonable balance between expressiveness and logical tractability. On
the one hand, it is flexible enough to represent many aspects of the
logical structure of natural language. On the other hand, automated
theorem proving for |FOL| has received much attention, and although
inference in |FOL| is not decidable, in practice many reasoning
problems are efficiently solvable using modern theorem provers.

..
   Standard textbooks on |fol| often contain exercises in
   which the reader is required to translate between English and logic,
   as illustrated in km_ and wq_.\ [#]_

   .. [#] These examples come, respectively, from D. Kalish and
	  R. Montague (1964) *Logic: Techniques of Formal Reasoning*,
	  Harcourt, Brace and World, p94, and W. v. Quine (1952) *Methods
	  of Logic*, Routledge and Kegan Paul, p121.


   .. _km:
   .. ex::

      .. ex:: If all whales are mammals, then Moby Dick is not a fish.

      .. ex:: |forall|\ `x`:math:\ (whale(`x`:math:) |rarr| mammal(`x`:math:)) |rarr| |neg|\ fish(MD)

   .. _wq:
   .. ex::

      .. ex:: There is a painting that all critics admire.

      .. ex:: |exists|\ `y`:math:\ (painting(`y`:math:) |wedge| |forall|\ `x`:math:\ (critic(`x`:math:) |rarr|  admire(`x`:math:, `y`:math:)))


Although there are numerous subtle and difficult issues about how to
translate natural language constructions into |FOL|, we will largely ignore
these. The main focus of our discussion will be on a
different problem: how can we systematically construct a semantic
representation for a sentence which can be smoothly integrated with the
process of parsing that sentence?

..
   This chapter will only scratch the surface of how to carry out
   semantic analysis of natural language, and will be heavily slanted
   towards the approach currently implemented within
   |NLTK|. Consequently, it needs to be read in conjunction with a good
   overall introduction to formal semantics. [Eg., B&B, Gamut, Heim?]

The overall framework we are assuming is illustrated in semint_. Given
a syntactic analysis of a sentence, we can build one or more semantic
representations for the sentence. Once we have a semantic
representation, we can also check whether it is true in a model. 

.. _semint:
.. ex::
   .. image:: ../images/semint.png
      :scale: 20

A model is a set-theoretic construction which provides a very
simplified picture of how the world is. For example, in this case, the
model should contain individuals (indicated in the diagram by small dots)
corresponding to Suzie and Fido, and it should also contain a set of
pairs of individuals that stand in the `chase`:math: relation.

The order of sections in this chapter is not what you might expect
from looking at semint_. We will start off by presenting a logical
language that will provide us with semantic representations in
|NLTK|. Next, we will show how formulas in the language can be
systematically evaluated in a model. At the end, we will bring
everything together and describe a simple method for constructing
semantic representations as part of the parse process in |NLTK|.

---------------------
The |lambda|-calculus
---------------------

In a functional programming language, computation can be carried out
by reducing an expression `E`:math: according to specified rewrite
rules. This reduction is carried out on subparts of `E`:math:, and
terminates when no further subexpressions can be reduced. The
resulting expression `E*`:math: is called the `Normal Form`:dt: of
`E`:math:. Here is an example of reduction involving a simple Python
expression (where '|reduce|' means 'reduces to'):

.. table:: Reduction of functions

 +------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 |                        | ``len(max(['cat', 'zebra', 'rabbit'] + ['gopher']))``   |
 +------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 |        |reduce|        | ``len(max(['cat', 'zebra', 'rabbit', 'gopher']))``      |
 +------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 |        |reduce|        | ``len('zebra')``                                        |
 +------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
 |      |reduce|          |  ``5``                                                  |
 +------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

The final expression, ``5``, is considered to be the output of the program.
This fundamental notion of computation is modeled in an abstract way by
something called the |lambda|-calculus (|lambda| is a Greek letter
pronounced 'lambda').

The first basic concept in the |lambda|-calculus is `application`:dt:,
represented by an expression of the form `(F A)`:mathit:, where `F`:mathit: is
considered to be a function, and `A`:mathit: is considered to be an
argument (or input) for `F`:mathit:.  For example, (`walk x`:mathit:) is
an application. Moreover, application expressions can be applied to
other expressions. So in a functional framework, binary addition might
represented as `((+ x) y)`:mathit: rather than `(x + y)`:mathit:. Note
that `+`:mathit: is being treated as a function which is applied to its
first argument `x`:mathit: to yield a function `(+ x)`:mathit: that is
then applied to the second argument `y`:mathit:.

The second basic concept in the |lambda|-calculus is
`abstraction`:dt:. If `M[x]`:mathit: is an expression containing the
free variable `x`:mathit:, then |lambda|\ `x.M[x]`:mathit: denotes the
function `x`:mathit: |mapsto| `M[x]`:mathit:. Abstraction and
application are combined in the expression (|lambda|\ `x.((+ x) 3)
4)`:mathit:, which denotes the function `x`:mathit: |mapsto| `x +
3`:mathit: applied to `4`:mathit:, giving `4 + 3`:mathit:, which is
`7`:mathit:. In general, we have

.. ex:: (|lambda|\ `x.M[x] N) = M[N]`:mathit:, 

:raw-latex:`\noindent` 
where `M[N]`:mathit: is the result of replacing all
occurences of `x`:mathit: in `M`:mathit: by `N`:mathit:. This axiom of the
lambda calculus is known as |beta|-conversion. |beta|-conversion is
the primary form of reduction in the |lambda|-calculus.

The module ``nltk_lite.semantics.logic`` can parse expressions of the
|lambda|-calculus. The |lambda| symbol is represented as ``'\'``. In
order to avoid having to escape this with a second ``'\'``, we use raw
strings in parsable expressions.

    >>> from nltk_lite.semantics.logic import *
    >>> lp = Parser()
    >>> lp.parse(r'(walk x)')
    ApplicationExpression('walk', 'x')
    >>> lp.parse(r'\x.(walk x)')
    LambdaExpression('x', '(walk x)')
       

An ``ApplicationExpression`` has subparts consisting of the function
and the argument; a ``LambdaExpression`` has subparts consisting of
the variable (e.g., ``x``) that is bound by the |lambda| and the body
of the expression (e.g., ``walk``).

The |lambda|-calculus is a calculus of functions; by itself, it says
nothing about logical structure. Although it is possible to define
logical operators within the |lambda|-calculus, we shall adopt a
hybrid approach which supplements the |lambda|-calculus with logical
and non-logical constants as primitives.
In order to show how this is done, we turn next to the language of
propositional logic.




Propositional  Logic
--------------------

The language of propositional logic represents
certain aspects of natural language, but at a high level of
abstraction. The only structure that is made explicit involves
`logical connectives`:dt:\; these correspond to 'logically
interesting' expressions such as `and`:lx: and `not`:lx:. The basic
expressions of the language are `propositional variables`:dt:, usually
written `p`:math:, `q`:math:, `r`:math:, etc. Let `A`:math: be a
finite set of such variables. The set of logical connectives
contains the unary operator |neg|, and binary operators |wedge|,
|vee|, |rarr| and |iff|. 

The set of formulas of is described inductively.

   1. Every element of `A`:math: is a formula of `L`:subscript:`prop`.

   2. If |phi| is a formula, then so is |neg| |phi|.

   3. If |phi| and |psi| are formulas, then so are
      (|phi| |wedge| |psi|),
      (|phi| |vee| |psi|),
      (|phi| |rarr| |psi|) and
      (|phi| |iff| |psi|).

   4. Nothing else is a formula of `L`:subscript:`prop`.

The Boolean connectives of propositional logic are supported by
``nltk_lite.semantics.logic``, and are parsed as objects of the class
``ApplicationExpression`` (i.e., function expressions). However, infix
notation is also allowed as an input format. The connectives
themselves belong to the ``Operator`` class of expressions.

   >>> lp.parse('(and p q)')
   ApplicationExpression('(and p)', 'q')
   >>> lp.parse('(p and q)')
   ApplicationExpression('(and p)', 'q')
   >>> lp.parse('and')
   Operator('and')
   >>> 

Since a negated proposition is syntactically an application, the unary
operator ``not`` and its argument must be surrounded by parentheses.

   >>> lp.parse('(not (p and q))')
   ApplicationExpression('not', '(and p q)')
   >>> 

Using the `print` function on an ``ApplicationExpression`` just
outputs a string without any parse structure. To make the output
even easier to read, we can invoke the ``infixify`` method, which
places binary Boolean operators in infix position.

   >>> e = lp.parse('(and p (not a))')
   >>> e
   ApplicationExpression('(and p)', '(not a)')
   >>> print e
   (and p (not a))
   >>> print e.infixify()
   (p and (not a))
      

First-Order Logic
-----------------

Predication
===========

In |fol| (|FOL|), propositions are further analysed into predicates
and arguments, which takes us a step closer to the structure of
natural languages. The standard construction rules for |FOL| recognize
`terms`:dt: such as individual variables and individual constants, and
`predicates`:dt: which take differing numbers of arguments. For
example, `John walks`:lx: might be formalized as `walk(john)`:mathit:
and `John sees Mary`:lx: as  `see(john, mary)`:mathit:.  Semantically,
`see`:mathit: is modeled as a relation, i.e., a set of
pairs, and the proposition is true in a situation just in case the
pair |langle|\ `j, m`:math:\ |rangle| belongs to this set. In order to
make it explicit that we are treating `see`:lx: as a relation, we'll
use the symbol |seeR| as its semantic representation, and we'll call
|seeR|\ `(john, mary)`:mathit: an instance of the
'relational style' of representing predication.

Within the framework of the |lambda|-calculus, there is an alternative
approach in which predication is treated as function application.  In
this functional style of representation, `John sees Mary`:lx: is
formalized as `((`:mathit: |seef| `m) j)`:mathit: or |mdash| a
shorthand with less brackets
|mdash| as `(`:mathit: |seef| `m j)`:mathit:. Rather than being modeled as a
relation, |seef| denotes a function. Before going into detail
about this function, let's first look at a simpler case, namely the
different styles of interpreting a unary constant such as
`walk`:mathit:.

In the relational approach, |walkR| denotes some set `W`:math: of
individuals. The formula |walkR|\ `(j)`:mathit: is true in a situation
if and only if the individual denoted by `j`:mathit: belongs to
`W`:math:. As we saw in Chapter `6 <advanced.html>`_, corresponding to
every set `S`:math: is the characteristic function `f`:math:\ :sub:`S`
of that set. To be specific, suppose in some situation our domain of
discourse `D`:math: is the set containing the individuals `j`:math:
(John), `m`:math: (Mary) and `f`:math: (Fido); and the set of
individuals that walk is `W = {j, f}`:math:. So in this situation, the
formulas |walkR|\ `(j)`:mathit: and |walkR|\ `(f)`:mathit: are both
true, while |walkR|\ `(m)`:mathit: is false.  Now we can use the
characteristic function `f`:subscript:`W` as the interpretation of
|walkf| in the functional style.  The diagram cf01_ gives a graphical
representation of the mapping `f`:subscript:`W`.

.. _cf01:
.. ex::
   .. image:: ../images/models_walk_cf.png
      :scale: 25

Binary relations can be converted into functions in a very similar
fashion. Suppose for example that on the relational style of
interpretation, |seeR| denotes the following set of pairs:

.. _loverel:
.. ex:: {|langle|\ `j, m`:math:\ |rangle|, |langle|\ `m, f`:math:\ |rangle|,  
         |langle|\ `f, j`:math:\ |rangle|}

|nopar| That is, John sees Mary, Mary sees Fido, and Fido sees
John. One option on the functional style would be to treat |seef| as
the expected characteristic function of this set, i.e., a function
`f`:math:\ :sub:`S`\ : `D`:math: |times| `D`:math: |mapsto| |tf|
(i.e., from pairs of individuals to truth values). This mapping is
illustrated in cf02_.

.. _cf02:
.. ex::
   .. image:: ../images/models_love_cf01.png
      :scale: 20

|nopar| However, recall that we are trying to build up our semantic analysis
compositionally; i.e., the meaning of a complex expression is a
function of the meaning of its parts. In the case of a sentence, what
are its parts? Presumably they are the subject `np`:gc: and the `vp`:gc:. So
let's consider what would be a suitable value for the `vp`:gc: `sees
Fido`:lx:. It cannot be |seef| denoting a function `D`:math:
|times| `D`:math: |mapsto| |tf|, since this is looking for a
`pair`:em: of arguments. A better meaning representation would be
|lambda|\ `x.`\ |seeR|\ `(x, Fido)`:mathit:, which is a function of a single
argument. This invites the question, what should be the representation
of the transitive verb `see`:lx:? A possible answer is shown in seef1_.

.. _seef1:
.. ex:: |seef| = |lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ |lambda|\ `x.`\ |seeR|\ 
        `(x, y)`:mathit:. 

|nopar| This defines |seef| to be a function expression which can be applied first
to the argument `f`:mathit: and then to `m`:mathit:\ :

.. ex:: (|lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ |lambda|\ `x.`\ |seeR|\ `(x, y) f m`:mathit:\ )
        |reduce| 
        (|lambda|\ `x.`\ |seeR|\ `(x, f) m)`:mathit: |reduce| 
        |seeR|\ `(m, f)`:mathit:

|nopar| seef1_ adopts a technique known as 'currying' (named after
Haskell B. Curry), in which a binary function is converted into a
function of one argument. As you can see, when we apply |seef| to an
argument such as `f`:mathit:, the value is another function, namely
the function denoted by |lambda|\ `x.`\ |seeR|\ `(x, f)`:mathit:.

..
   This idea can be illustrated with
   |lambda|-abstraction. Suppose we have an application `see(x, y)`:mathit:
   which depends on two arguments. In currying, we define

   .. _L1:
   .. ex:: `L`:subscript:`1` = |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y)`:mathit:
   .. _L2:
   .. ex:: `L`:subscript:`2` = |lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ `L`:subscript:`1` =
	   |lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y)`:mathit:

   That is, `L`:subscript:`1` = |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y)`:mathit: is a
   function of only one argument, namely `x`:mathit:, and
   `L`:subscript:`2` is also a function of only one argument, this time
   `y`:mathit:. Just as importantly, the *value* of `L`:subscript:`2` is
   a function, namely `L`:subscript:`1`. If we think of `see(x,
   y)`:mathit: as the formalization of `x sees y`:lx:, then
   `L`:subscript:`1` = |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y)`:mathit: corresponds intuitively to
   the property of being an `x`:lx: that sees `y`:lx:.  According to
   these definitions (and using |beta|-conversion), we have:

   .. ex:: ((`L`:subscript:`2` `m`:mathit:\ ) `j`:mathit:\ )
	   = (`L`:subscript:`1` `j`:mathit:\ ) = `see(j, m)`:mathit:

   or equivalently,

   .. ex::  ((|lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y) m) j)`:mathit:
	    = |lambda|\ `x.see(x, m) j)`:mathit: 
	    = `see(j, m)`:mathit:


Diagram cf03_ shows the curryed counterpart of cf02_, and presents a
function which, for example, given the argumenat `j`:mathit: yields a
characteristic function that maps `m`:mathit: to *True* and
`j`:mathit: and `f`:mathit: to *False*.
(While there are 2\ :sup:`3` = 8 characteristic functions from our
domain of three individuals into {*True*, *False*}, we have only shown
the functions which are in the range of the function denoted by |seef|.)

.. _cf03:
.. ex::
   .. image:: ../images/models_love_cf02.png
      :scale: 20

|nopar| Now, rather than define |seef| by abstracting over a formula
containing |seeR|, we can interpret directly with a function like that
shown in cf03_.

..
   Of course, we could have done things slightly differently, and defined
   `L`:subscript:`1` = |lambda|\ `y.see(x, y)`:mathit:, and
   `L`:subscript:`2` = |lambda|\ `x.`:mathit:\ `L`:subscript:`1`. And L1_
   and L2_ might strike you as a bit perverse since we consume the
   arguments in an order that appears to be opposite to `see(x,
   y)`:mathit:. Yet there is something very attractive about L1_ and L2_,
   since (`L`:subscript:`2` `m`:mathit:) is just the right function to serve as the
   denotation of the `VP`:gc: `sees Mary`:lx:. That is, if `sees`:lx: is
   interpreted as |lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y)`:mathit:,
   then combining the verb with an object `NP`:gc: such as `Mary`:lx:
   yields a `VP`:gc: interpretation
   (|lambda|\ `y.`:mathit:\ |lambda|\ `x.see(x, y) m)`:mathit: = |lambda|\
   `x.see(x, m)`:mathit:, which can then combine with a subject `NP`:gc:
   such as `John`:lx: to yield the interpretation `see(j, m)`:mathit:. In
   fact, doing things according to  L1_
   and L2_ allows the semantic construction rules to mirror the syntactic
   construction rules, and thus provides an extremely elegant basis for a
   compositional approach to semantic interpretation.

we have just examined.

In order to be slightly more formal about how we are treating the
syntax of |fol|, it is helpful to look first at the `typed lambda
calculus`:dt:. We will take as our basic types **Ind** and **Bool**,
corresponding to the domain of individuals and |tf|
respectively. Basic types are types. If |sigma| and |tau| are types,
then (|sigma| |rarr| |tau|) is also a type; this corresponds to the
set of functions from things of type |sigma| to things of type
|tau|. We omit the parentheses around |sigma| |rarr| |tau| if there is
no ambiguity. For any type |tau|, we have a set **Var**\ (|tau|) of variables of type
|tau| and **Con**\ (|tau|) of constants of type |tau|. We can now define
the set **Term**\ (|tau|) of |lambda|-terms of type |tau|.

1. **Var**\ (|tau|) |subset|  **Term**\ (|tau|)

2. **Con**\ (|tau|) |subset|  **Term**\ (|tau|)

3. If |alpha| |element|  **Term**\ (|sigma| |rarr| |tau|) and |beta| 
   |element|  **Term**\ (|sigma|),
   then (|alpha| |beta|)  |element|  **Term**\ (|tau|)

4. If `x`:mathit: |element|  **Var**\ (|sigma|) and |alpha| 
   |element|  **Term**\ (|tau|),
   then |lambda|\ `x.`:mathit:\ |alpha|  |element|  **Term**\ (|sigma|
   |rarr| |tau|). 

|nopar| We can replace our earlier definition of the language of propositional
logic by adding the following stipulations for Boolean connectives:

5. `not`:mathit: |element|  **Con**\ (**Bool** |rarr| **Bool**), and
   `and`:mathit:, `or`:mathit:, `implies`:mathit: and `iff`:mathit:
   |element| **Con**\ (**Bool** |rarr| (**Bool** |rarr| **Bool**)).


|nopar| We also add a clause for equality between individual terms.

6. If |alpha|, |beta| |element|  **Term**\ (**Ind**), 
   then  |alpha| = |beta|  **Term**\ (**Bool**). 

If we return now to |NLTK|, we can see that our previous implementation
of function application already does service for predication.
We also note that |lambda|-abstraction can be combined with terms that
are conjoined by Boolean operators. For
example, the following can be thought of as the property of being an
`x`:math: who walks and talks:

  >>> lp = Parser()
  >>> lp.parse('\\x.((walk x) and (talk x))')
  LambdaExpression('x', '(and (walk x) (talk x))')
     

|beta|-conversion can be invoked with the ``simplify`` method of
``ApplicationExpression``\ s. ``infixify`` will place binary Boolean
connectives in infix position.

  >>> e = lp.parse('(\\x.((walk x) and (talk x)) john)')
  >>> e
  ApplicationExpression('\x.(and (walk x) (talk x))', 'john')
  >>> print e.simplify()
  (and (walk john) (talk john))
  >>> print e.simplify().infixify()
  ((walk john) and (talk john))
  >>> 


Up to this point, we have restricted ourselves to looking at formulas
where all the arguments are individual constants (i.e., expressions in
**Term**\ (**Ind**)), corresponding to proper
names such as `John`:lx:, `Mary`:lx: and `Fido`:lx:. Yet a crucial
ingredient of |fol| is the ability to make general
statements involving quantified expressions such as `all dogs`:lx: and
`some cats`:lx:. We turn to this topic in the next section.


Quantification and Scope
========================

|Fol| standardly offers us two quantifiers, `every`:lx: (or `all`:lx:) and
`some`:lx:. These are formally written as |forall| and |exists|,
respectively. The following two triples show an a simple English
example, a logical representation, and the encoding which is accepted
by the |NLTK| `logic` module.

.. _forall1:
.. ex::

   .. _forall1a:
   .. ex:: Every dog barks.

   .. _forall1b:
   .. ex:: |forall|\ `x`:mathit:.\ ((dog `x`:mathit:) |rarr| (bark `x`:mathit:))

   .. _forall1c:
   .. ex:: `all x. ((dog x) implies (bark x))`

.. _exists1:
.. ex::

   .. ex:: Some cat sleeps.

   .. ex:: |exists|\ `x`:mathit:.\ ((cat `x`:mathit:) |wedge| (sleep `x`:mathit:))

   .. ex:: `some x. ((cat x) and (sleep x))`

|nopar| The inclusion of first-order quantifiers motivates the final clause of
the definition of our version of |fol|.

7. If `x`:mathit: |element|  **Var**\ (**Ind**) and |phi| 
   |element|  **Term**\ (**Bool**), then |forall|\ `x.`:mathit:\
   |phi|, |exists|\ `x.`:mathit:\ |phi|  |element|  **Term**\
   (**Bool**).  

One important property of forall1b_ often trips people up. The logical
rendering in effects says that *if* something is a dog, then it barks,
but makes no commitment to the existence of dogs. So in a situation
where nothing is a dog, forall1b_ will still come out true. (Although
it might be felt that forall1b_ does presuppose the existence of dogs,
contrary to the logic formalization, other examples such as `all students
with more than 10 body piercings are prohibited from taking this
class`:lx:: lacks any such presupposition.) 

What happens when we want to give a formal rendering of a sentence
with *two* quantifiers, such as the following?

.. _scope1:
.. ex:: Every girl chases a dog.

There are (at least) two ways of expressing scope1_ in |FOL|:

.. _scope2:
.. ex::

   .. _scope2a:
   .. ex:: |forall|\ `x`:mathit:.\ ((girl `x`:mathit:) |rarr|\ |exists|\
           `y`:mathit:.\ ((dog `y`:mathit:) |wedge| (chase `y x`:mathit:)))

   .. _scope2b:
   .. ex:: |exists|\ `y`:mathit:.\ ((dog `y`:mathit:) |wedge| |forall|\
           `x`:mathit:.\ ((every `x`:mathit:) |rarr|\  (chase `y x`:mathit:))) 

Can we use both of these? Then answer is Yes, but they have different
meanings. scope2b_ is logically stronger than scope2a_: it claims that
there is a unique dog, say Fido, which is chased by every girl.
scope2a_, on the other hand, just requires that for every girl
`g`:mathit:, we can find some dog which `d`:mathit: chases; but this could
be a different dog in each case. We distinguish between scope2a_ and
scope2b_ in terms of the `scope`:dt: of the quantifiers. In the first,
|forall| has wider scope than |exists|, while in scope2b_, the scope ordering
is reversed. So now we have two ways of representing the meaning of
scope1_, and they are both quite legitimate. In other words, we are
claiming that scope1_ is *ambiguous* with respect to quantifier scope,
and the formulas in scope2_ give us a formal means of making the two
readings explicit. However, we are not just interested in associating
two distinct representations with scope1_. We also want to show in
detail how the two representations lead to different conditions for
truth in a formal model. This will be taken up in the next section.


Alphabetic Variants
===================

When carrying out |beta|-reduction, some care has to be taken with
variables. Consider, for example, the |lambda| terms alpha1a_ and
alpha1b_, which differ only in the identity of a free variable.

.. _alpha1:
.. ex::

   .. _alpha1a:
   .. ex:: |lambda|\ `y.(see x y)`:mathit:

   .. _alpha1b:
   .. ex:: |lambda|\ `y.(see z y)`:mathit:

Suppose now that we apply the |lambda| term alpha2_ to each of these
terms. 

.. _alpha2:
.. ex:: |lambda|\ `P`:mathit: |exists|\ `x.(P x)`:mathit:

In principle, the results of the application should be semantically equivalent,
but if we let the free variable `x`:mathit: in alpha1a_ be 'captured' by the
existential quantifier in alpha2_, then after reduction, the results
will be different:


.. _alpha3:
.. ex::

   .. _alpha3a:
   .. ex:: |exists|\ `x.(see x x)`:mathit:

   .. _alpha3b:
   .. ex:: |exists|\ `x.(see z x)`:mathit:

alpha3a_ means there is some `x`:mathit: that sees themselves, whereas
alpha3b_ means that there is some `x`:mathit: that sees an unspecified
individual `y`:mathit:. What has gone wrong here? The main point to note
is that given any variable-binding expression (involving |forall|,
|exists| or |lambda|), the particular name chosen for the bound
variable is completely arbitrary. For example, alpha4a_ and alpha4b_
are completely equivalent; in fact, they are called `|alpha|
equivalents`:dt: (or `alphabetic variants`:dt:).

.. _alpha4:
.. ex::

   .. _alpha4a:
   .. ex::  |exists|\ `x.(P x)`:mathit:

   .. _alpha4b:
   .. ex::  |exists|\ `z`:mathit:\ :sub:`0`\ `.(P z`:mathit:\ :sub:`0` `)`:mathit:


The process of relabeling bound variables (which takes us from
alpha4a_ to alpha4b_) is known as `|alpha|-conversion`:dt:. The
``equals`` method on ``VariableBinderExpression``\s in the ``logic``
module is in fact |alpha|-equivalence:

   >>> lp = Parser()
   >>> e1 = lp.parse('some x.(P x)')
   >>> print e1
   some x.(P x)
   >>> e2 = e1.alpha_convert(Variable('z'))
   >>> print e2
   some z.(P z)
   >>> e1.equals(e2)
   True
   >>> 

When |beta|-reduction is carried out on an application `(M N)`:mathit:,
we check whether there are free variables in `N`:mathit: which also
occur as bound variables in any subterms of `M`:mathit:. Suppose, as in
the example discussed above, that `x`:mathit: is free in `N`:mathit:, and
that `M`:mathit: contains the subterm |exists|\ `x.(P x)`:mathit:. In this
case, we produce an alphabetic variant of |exists|\ `x.(P x)`:mathit:,
say, |exists|\ `z.(P z)`:mathit:, and then carry on with the
reduction. This relabeling is carried out automatically by the
|beta|-reduction code in ``logic``, and the results can be seen in the
following example.

   >>> e3 = lp.parse('(\P.some x.(P x) \y.(see x y))')
   >>> print e3
   (\P.some x.(P x) \y.(see x y))
   >>> print e3.simplify()
   some z2.(see x z2)
   >>> 

Types and the Untyped |lambda|-calculus
=======================================


So far, we have glossed over the fact that the
``nltk_lite.semantics.logic`` module is based on an implementation of
the `untyped`:em: lambda calculus. That is, although we have
introduced typing in order to aid exposition, the logical language we
will be using in |NLTK| is not constrained to honour that typing.

..
   In addition, all identifiers are
   considered to be variables. This means, for example, that the
   identifier ``walk`` can be bound by |lambda|:

      >>> lp.parse('walk')
      VariableExpression('walk')
      >>> lp.parse('\\walk.(walk x)')
      LambdaExpression('walk', '(walk x)')

|nopar|
In particular, there is no formal
distinction between predicate expressions and individual expressions;
anything can be applied to anything. Indeed, functions can be applied
to themselves:

   >>> lp.parse('(walk walk)')
   ApplicationExpression('walk', 'walk')

By contrast, most standard approaches to natural language semantics forbid
self-application (e.g., applications such as `(walk walk)`:mathit:) by
adopting a typed language of the kind presented above.

.. [#] When combined with logic, unrestricted self-application leads
      to Russell's Paradox.

It is also standard to allow constants as basic expressions of the
language, as indicated by our use **Con**\ (|tau|) is our earlier
definitions. Correspondingly, we have used a mixture of convention and
supplementary stipulations in the ``logic`` module to bring our
practice closer to this more standard framework for natural language
semantics.  In particular, we use expressions like `x`:math:,
`y`:math:, `z`:math:, or `x`:subscript:`0`, `x`:subscript:`1`,
`x`:subscript:`2`, ... to indicate individual variables.  As an
extension over the 'pure' |lambda|-calculus syntax of ``logic``, we
can assign such strings to the class ``IndVariableExpression``.

  >>> lp.parse('x')
  IndVariableExpression('x')
  >>> lp.parse('x01')
  IndVariableExpression('x01')
  >>> 

English-like expressions such as `dog`:math:,
`walk`:math: and `john`:math: will be non-logical constants
(non-logical in contrast to logical constants such as `not`:math: and
`and`:math:). In order to force ``logic.Parser()`` to recognize
non-logical constants, we can initialize the parser with a list of
identifiers.

  >>> lp = Parser(constants=['dog', 'walk', 'see'])
  >>> lp.parse('walk')
  ConstantExpression('walk')
  >>> 

To sum up, while the untyped |lambda|-calculus only recognizes one kind of
basic expression other than |lambda|, namely the class of variables
(the class ``VariableExpression`` in ``logic``), our extended language
adds to ``logic`` three further classes of basic expression:
``IndVariableExpression``, ``ConstantExpression`` and ``Operator``
(Boolean connectives plus the equality relation ``=``).

This completes our discussion of using a first-order language as a
basis for semantic representation in |NLTK|. In the next section, we
will study how the language is to be used. 

----------------
Formal Semantics
----------------

So far, we have presented some basic ideas about defining a semantic
representation language, and given a
number of examples of how expressions of that language are paired up
with natural language expressions. Later on, we will investigate a
more systematic method for carrying out that pairing. But let's
suppose for a moment that for any sentence `S`:math: of English, we
have a method of building a
corresponding expression of |fol| that represents the meaning of
`S`:math: (still a fairly distant goal, unfortunately). Would this be
enough? Within the tradition of formal semantics, the answer would be
No. Let's see why this is.



A `model`:dt: for |FOL| is a pair `<D,V>`:math:, where `D`:math: is a
domain of discourse and `V`:math: is a valuation function for the
non-logical constants of a first-order language. 
As a first approximation, non-logical constants are interpreted
by `V`:math: as follows (note that `e`:math: is the type of
entities and `t`:math: is the type of truth values):

  - if |alpha| is an individual constant, then `V`:math:\ (|alpha|)
    is an element of the domain `D`:math:.
  - If |gamma| is a functor of type 
    (`e`:math: x ... x `e`:math:) |rarr| `t`:math:, then
    `V`:math:(|gamma|) is a function `f`:math: from  
    `D`:math: x ... x `D`:math: to {True, False}.

However, since we are basing our language on the |lambda|-calculus, a
binary relation such as the interpretation of `like`:lx: will not in
fact be associated with the relational type (`e`:math: x `e`:math:)
|rarr| `t`:math:, but rather the type (`e`:math: |rarr| (`e`:math:
|rarr| `t`:math:)); i.e., a function from entities to a function from
entities to truth values. In other words, as explained earlier,
functor expressions are assigned 'curryed' functions as their values. It should
also be noted that expressions of the language are not explicitly
typed.  We leave it to the grammar writer to assign 'sensible' values
to expressions rather than enforcing any type-to-denotation
consistency.

Characteristic Functions
------------------------

Within the ``models`` module, curryed characteristic functions are
implemented as a subclass of dictionaries, using the ``CharFun``
constructor.

   >>> cf = CharFun({'d1' : CharFun({'d2': True}), 'd2' : CharFun({'d1': True})})

Values of a ``CharFun`` are accessed by indexing in the usual way:

   >>> cf['d1']
   {'d2': True}
   >>> cf['d1']['d2']
   True
      

``CharFun``\ s are 'sparse' data structures in the sense that they omit
key-value pairs of the form ``(e: False)``. In fact, they
behave just like ordinary dictionaries on keys which are
out of their domain, rather than yielding the value ``False``:

   >>> cf['not in domain']
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   KeyError: 'not in domain'

The assignment of ``False`` values is delegated to a wrapper method
``app`` of the ``Model`` class. ``app`` embodies the Closed World
assumption; i.e., where ``m`` is an instance of ``Model``:

   >>> m.app(cf,'not in domain')
   False
      


In practise, it is often be more convenient to specify interpretations
as `n`:math:-ary relations (i.e., sets of `n`:math:-tuples) rather
than as `n`:math:-ary functions. ``CharFun`` provides a ``read``
method which will convert such relations into curryed characteristic
functions:

   >>> s = set([('d1', 'd2'), ('d3', 'd4')])
   >>> cf = CharFun()
   >>> cf.read(s)
   >>> cf
   {'d2': {'d1': True}, 'd4': {'d3': True}}
      

``cf.read`` will raise an exception if the set is not in fact a
relation (i.e., if it contains tuples of different lengths):

  >>> wrong = set([('d1', 'd2'), ('d2', 'd1', 'd3')])
  >>> cf.read(wrong)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  ValueError: Set contains sequences of different lengths

However, unary relations can be parsed to characteristic functions.

  >>> unary = set(['d1', 'd2'])
  >>> cf.read(unary)
  >>> cf
  {'d2': True, 'd1': True}
     

The function ``flatten`` returns a set of the entities used as keys in
a ``CharFun`` instance. The same information can be accessed via the
``domain`` attribute of ``CharFun``.

   >>> cf = CharFun({'d1' : {'d2': True}, 'd2' : {'d1': True}})
   >>> flatten(cf)
   set(['d2', 'd1'])
   >>> cf.domain
   set(['d2', 'd1'])
      



Valuations
----------

A `Valuation`:dt: is a mapping from non-logical constants to
appropriate semantic values in the model. Valuations are created using
the ``Valuation`` constructor.

   >>> val = Valuation({'Fido' : 'd1', 'dog' : {'d1' : True, 'd2' : True}})
   >>> val
   {'Fido': 'd1', 'dog': {'d2': True, 'd1': True}}
      

As with ``CharFun``, an instance of ``Valuation`` will parse
valuations using relations rather than characteristic functions as
interpretations.

   >>> setval = [('adam', 'b1'), ('betty', 'g1'),\
   ('girl', set(['g2', 'g1'])), ('boy', set(['b1', 'b2'])),\
   ('see', set([('b1', 'g1'), ('b2', 'g2'), ('g1', 'b1'), ('g2', 'b1')]))]
   >>> val = Valuation()
   >>> val.read(setval)
   >>> print val
   {'adam': 'b1',
   'betty': 'g1',
   'boy': {'b1': True, 'b2': True},
   'girl': {'g2': True, 'g1': True},
   'see': {'b1': {'g2': True, 'g1': True},
            'g1': {'b1': True},
            'g2': {'b2': True}}}
       

Valuations have a ``domain`` attribute, like ``CharFun``, and also a
``symbols`` attribute.

   >>> val.domain
   set(['g1', 'g2', 'b2', 'b1'])
   >>> val.symbols
   ['boy', 'girl', 'see, 'adam', 'betty']
      


Assignments
-----------

A variable `Assignment`:dt: is a mapping from individual variables to
entities in the domain. Individual variables are indicated with the
letters ``'x'``, ``'y'``, ``'w'`` and ``'z'``, optionally followed by
an integer (e.g., ``'x0'``, ``'y332'``).  Assignments are created
using the ``Assignment`` constructor, which also takes the model's
domain of discourse as a parameter.

   >>> dom = set(['u1', 'u2', 'u3', 'u4'])
   >>> g = Assignment(dom, {'x': 'u1', 'y': 'u2'})
   >>> g
   {'y': 'u2', 'x': 'u1'}
      

In addition, there is also a ``print`` format for assignments which
uses a notation closer to that in logic textbooks:
   
   >>> print g
   g[u2/y][u1/x]
      

Initialization of an ``Assignment`` instance checks that the variable
really is an individual variable and also that the value belongs to
the domain of discourse:

    >>> Assignment(dom, {'xxx': 'u1', 'y': 'u2'})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Wrong format for an Individual Variable: 'xxx'
    >>> Assignment(dom, {'x': 'u5', 'y': 'u2'})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: 'u5' is not in the domain: set(['u4', 'u1', 'u3', 'u2'])

It is possible to update an assignment using the ``add`` method, with
similar restrictions:

    >>> dom = set(['u1', 'u2', 'u3', 'u4'])
    >>> g = models.Assignment(dom, {})
    >>> g.add('u1', 'x')
    {'x': 'u1'}
    >>> g.add('u1', 'xyz')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Wrong format for an Individual Variable: 'xyz'
    >>> g.add('u2', 'x').add('u3', 'y').add('u4', 'x0')
    {'y': 'u3', 'x': 'u2', 'x0': 'u4'}
    >>> g.add('u5', 'x')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: u5 is not in the domain set(['u4', 'u1', 'u3', 'u2'])

Variables (and their values) can be selectively removed from an
assignment with the ``purge`` method:

    >>> g
    {'y': 'u3', 'x': 'u2', 'x0': 'u4'}
    >>> g.purge('x')
    >>> g
    {'y': 'u3', 'x0': 'u4'}
       

With no arguments,  ``purge`` is equivalent to ``clear`` on a dictionary:

    >>> g.purge()
    >>> g
    {}
       

`evaluate` and `satisfy`
------------------------

The ``Model`` constructor takes two parameters, a ``set`` and a
``Valuation``.

   >>> m = Model(val.domain, val)

The top-level method of a ``Model`` instance is ``evaluate``, which
assigns a semantic value to expressions of the ``logic`` module, under
an assignment ``g``:

    >>> m.evaluate('all x. ((boy x) implies (not (girl x)))', g)
    True
       

The function ``evaluate`` calls a recursive function ``satisfy``,
which in turn calls a function ``i`` to interpret non-logical
constants and individual variables. ``i`` first tries to call the
model's ``Valuation`` and if that fails, calls the variable assignment
``g``. Any atomic expression which cannot be assigned a value by ``i``
raises an ``Undefined`` exception; this is caught by ``evaluate``,
which returns the string 'Undefined'.

    >>> m.evaluate('(walk adam)', g, trace=2)
       ... checking whether 'walk' is an individual variable
    Expression 'walk' can't be evaluated by i and g.
    'Undefined'

..
 Boolean operators such as `not`:mathit:, `and`:mathit: and `implies`:mathit: are
 implemented as dictionaries. For example:

     >>> m.AND
     {False: {False: False, True: False}, True: {False: False, True: True}}


The ``satisfy`` function assigns semantic values to arbitrary expressions
according to their syntactic structure, as determined by ``decompose``.

Following the functional style of interpretation, Boolean connectives
in `models` are interpreted as truth functions; for example,
the connective `and` can be interpreted as the function
`AND`:

.. doctest-ignore::
     >>> AND = {True:  {True: True, 
     ...               False: False},
     ...       False: {True: False, 
     ...               False: False}}

We define `OPS` as a mapping between the Boolean connectives
and their associated truth functions. Then the simplified clause for
the satisfaction of Boolean formulas looks as follows:

.. doctest-ignore::
     >>> def satisfy(expr, g):
     ...   if parsed(expr) == (op, args) 
     ...      if args == (phi, psi):
     ...         val1 = self.satisfy(phi, g)
     ...         val2 = self.satisfy(psi, g)
     ...         return OPS[op][val1][val2]

A formula such as `(and p q)` is interpreted by indexing
the value of `and` with the values of the two propositional arguments,
in the following manner:

   >>> m.AND[m.evaluate('p', g)][m.evaluate('q', g)]


The `satisfy` clause for function application is similar to that for
the connectives. In order to handle type errors, application is
delegated to a wrapper function `app` rather than by directly indexing
the curryed characteristic function as described earlier. The
definition of `satisfy` started above continues as follows:

.. doctest-ignore::  
     ...   elif parsed(expr) == (fun, arg):
     ...      funval = self.satisfy(fun, g)
     ...      argval = self.satisfy(psi, g)
     ...      return app(funval, argval)

The first step in interpreting quantified formulas is to define the
`satisfiers`:dt: of a formula that is open in some variable. Formally,
given an open formula |phi|\ `[x]`:mathit: dependent on `x`:mathit: and a
model with domain `D`:math:, we define the set `sat`:mathit:\ (|phi|\
`[x], g)`:math: of satisfiers of |phi|\ `[x]`:mathit: to be: `{u`:math:
|in| `D:`:math: `satisfy`:mathit:\ (|phi|\ `[x], g[u/x]`) =
`True`:mathit:\ `}`:math:.  We use `g[u/x]`:math: to mean that
assignment which is just like `g`:math: except that `g(x) =
u`:math:. In Python, it is straightforward to build the set
`sat`:mathit:\ (|phi|\ `[x], g)`:math: with a `for` loop.

An existentially quantified formula |exists|\ `x.`:mathit:\ |phi|\
`[x]`:mathit: is held to be true if and only if `sat`:mathit:\ (|phi|\ `[x],
g)`:math: is nonempty. In Python, sets are a kind of collection (like
lists), and the length function `len` returns the cardinality
of a set.  

.. doctest-ignore::
     ...   elif parsed(expr) == (binder, body):
     ...      if binder = ('some', var):
     ...         sat = self.satisfiers(body, var, g)
     ...         return len(sat) > 0


In other words, a formula |exists|\ `x.`:mathit: |phi|\ `[x]`:mathit: has
the same value in model `M`:math: as the statement that the number of
satisfiers in `M`:math: of |phi|\ `[x]`:mathit: is greater than 0.


Quantifier Scope Revisited
--------------------------

You may recall that we discussed earlier an example of quantifier
scope ambiguity, repeated here as scope4_.

.. _scope4:
.. ex:: Every girl chases a dog.

The two readings are represented as follows.

   >>> sr1 = 'all x.((girl x) implies some z.((dog z) and (chase z x)))'
   >>> sr2 = 'some z.((dog z) and all x.((girl x) implies (chase z x)))'

In order to examine the ambiguity more closely, let's fix our valuation as
follows:

   >>> val = models.Valuation()
   >>> v = [('john', 'b1'),
   ... ('mary', 'g1'),
   ... ('suzie', 'g2'),
   ... ('fido', 'd1'),
   ... ('tess', 'd2'),
   ... ('noosa', 'n'),
   ... ('girl', set(['g1', 'g2'])),
   ... ('boy', set(['b1', 'b2'])),
   ... ('dog', set(['d1', 'd2'])),
   ... ('bark', set(['d1', 'd2'])),
   ... ('walk', set(['b1', 'g2', 'd1'])),
   ... ('chase', set([('b1', 'g1'), ('b2', 'g1'), ('g1', 'd1'), ('g2', 'd2')])),
   ... ('see', set([('b1', 'g1'), ('b2', 'd2'), ('g1', 'b1'),('d2', 'b1'), ('g2', 'n')])),
   ... ('in', set([('b1', 'n'), ('b2', 'n'), ('d2', 'n')])),
   ... ('with', set([('b1', 'g1'), ('g1', 'b1'), ('d1', 'b1'), ('b1', 'd1')]))]
   >>> val.parse(v)


Using a slightly different graph from before, we can also visualise the
`chase`:mathit: relation as in chasegraph_.

.. _chasegraph:
.. ex::
   .. image:: ../images/models_chase.png
      :scale: 20

In chasegraph_, an arrow between two individuals `x`:mathit: and
`y`:mathit: indicates that `x`:mathit: chases
`y`:mathit:. So ``b1`` and ``b2`` both chase ``g1``, while ``g1`` chases
``d1`` and ``g2`` chases ``d2``. In this model, formula ``sr1`` above
is true but ``sr2`` is false. One way of exploring these results is by
using the ``satisfiers`` method of ``Model`` objects.

   >>> dom = val.domain
   >>> m = model.Model(dom, val)
   >>> g = model.Assignment(dom)
   >>> fmla1 = '((girl x) implies some y.((dog y) and (chase y x)))'
   >>> m.satisfiers(fmla1, 'x', g)
   set(['g2', 'g1', 'n', 'b1', 'b2', 'd2', 'd1'])
   >>> 

This gives us the set of individuals that can be assigned as the value
of ``x`` in ``fmla1``. In particular, every girl is included in this
set. By contrast, consider the formula ``fmla2`` below; this has no
satisfiers for the variable ``y``.

   >>> fmla2 = '((dog y) and all x.((girl x) implies (chase y x)))'
   >>> m.satisfiers(fmla2, 'y', g)
   set([])
   >>> 

That is, there is no dog that is chased by both ``g1`` and
``g2``. Taking a slightly different open formula, ``fmla3``, we
can verify that there is a girl, namely ``g1``, who is chased by every boy.

   >>> fmla3 = '((girl y) and all x.((boy x) implies (chase y x)))'
   >>> m.satisfiers(fmla3, 'y', g)
   set(['g1'])
   >>> 

----------------------------
Evaluating English Sentences
----------------------------

So far, we have just taken for granted that we have some appropriate
logical formulas to interpret. However, ideally we would like to
derive these formulas from natural language input. One relatively easy
way of achieving this goal is to build on the grammar framework
developed in the chapter `Feature Based Grammar
<featgram.html>`__. Our first step is to introduce a new feature,
``sem``. Because values of ``sem`` generally need to be treated
differently from other feature values, we can use the convention of
enclosing them in angle brackets. sem1_ illustrates a first
approximation to the kind of analyses we would like to build.

.. _sem1:
.. ex::
   .. tree:: (S[sem=\<\(walk\ john\)\>] (NP[sem=\<\(john\)\>] John) (VP[sem=\<\walk\>] (V[sem=\<\walk\>] walks)))

Thus, the ``sem`` value at the root node shows a semantic
representation for the whole sentence, while the ``sem`` values at
lower nodes show semantic representations for constituents of the
sentence. So far, so good, but how do we write grammar rules which
will give us this kind of result? To be more specific, suppose we have
a `NP`:gc: and `VP`:gc: constituents with appropriate values for their
``sem`` nodes? If you reflect on the machinery that was introduced in
discussing the |lambda| calculus, you might guess that function
application will be central to composing semantic values. You will
also remember that our feature-based grammar framework gives us the
means to refer to `variable`:em: values. Putting this together, we can
postulate a rule like sem2_ for building the ``sem`` value of an
`S`:gc:.  (Observe that in the case where the value of ``sem`` is a
variable, we omit the angle brackets.)

.. _sem2:

     S[sem = <app(?vp,?subj)>] -> NP[sem=?subj] VP[sem=?vp]

sem2_ tells us that given some ``sem`` value ``?subj`` for the subject
`NP`:gc: and some ``sem`` value ``?vp`` for the `VP`:gc:, the ``sem``
value of the `S`:gc: mother is constructed by applying ``?vp`` as a
functor to ``?np``.  From this, we can conclude that ``?vp`` has to
denote a function which has the denotation of ``?np`` in its
domain; in fact, we are going to assume that ``?vp`` denotes a
characteristic function on individuals. sem2_ is a nice example of
building semantics using `the principle of compositionality`:dt:\:
that is, the principle that the semantics of a complex expression is a
function of the semantics of its parts.

To complete the grammar is very straightford; all we require are the
rules shown in sem3_.

.. _sem3:
.. ex::
   ::

     VP[sem=?v] -> IV[sem=?v]
     NP[sem=<john>] -> 'John'
     IV[sem=<walk>] -> 'walks'

The `VP`:gc: rule says that the mother's semantics is the same as the
head daughter's. The two lexical rules just introduce non-logical
constants to serve as the semantic values of `John`:lx: and
`walks`:lx: respectively. This grammar can be parsed using the chart
parser in ``nltk_lite.parse.featurechart``, and the trace in sem4_
shows how semantic values are derived by feature unification in the
process of building a parse tree.

.. _sem4:
.. ex::
   ::

     Predictor |> . .| S[sem='(?vp ?subj)'] -> * NP[sem=?subj] VP[sem=?vp] 
     Scanner   |[-] .| [0:1] 'John' 
     Completer |[-> .| S[sem='(?vp john)'] -> NP[sem='john'] * VP[sem=?vp] 
     Predictor |. > .| VP[sem=?v] -> * IV[sem=?v] 
     Scanner   |. [-]| [1:2] 'walks' 
     Completer |. [-]| VP[sem='walk'] -> IV[sem='walk'] * 
     Completer |[===]| S[sem='(walk john)'] -> NP[sem='john'] VP[sem='walk'] * 
     Completer |[===]| [INIT] -> S * 

You might be thinking this is all too easy |mdash| surely there is a
bit more to building compositional semantics. What about quantifiers,
for instance? Right, this is a crucial issue. For example, we want
sem5a_ to be given a semantic representation like sem5b_. How can this
be accomplished? 

.. _sem5: 
.. ex::
   .. _sem5a:
   .. ex:: 
      A dog barks.
   .. _sem5b:
   .. ex:: 
      some x. ((dog x) and (bark x)) 

Let's make the assumption that our `only`:em: operation for building
complex semantic representations is ``app`` (corresponding to function
application). Then our problem is this: how do we give a semantic
representation to quantified `NP`:gc:\s such as `a dog`:lx: so that
they can be combined with something like `walk`:mathit: to give a result
like sem5b_? As a first step, let's make the subject's ``sem`` value
act as the functor rather than the argument in ``app``. Now we are
looking for way of instantiating ``?np`` so that sem6_ holds.

.. _sem6: 
.. ex::
   ::

     [sem=<app(?np, bark)>] ->> [sem=<some x.((dog x) and (bark x))>]

This is where |lambda| abstraction comes to the
rescue; doesn't sem6_ look a bit reminiscent of carrying out |beta|-reduction in the
|lambda|-calculus? In other words, can we come up with a |lambda| term `M`:mathit:
to replace ``?np`` so that applying `M`:mathit: to ``bark`` yields
sem5b_? Indeed we can; we replace the occurence of ``bark`` in sem5b_
by a variable ``P``, and bind the variable with |lambda|, as shown in sem7_.

.. _sem7: 
.. ex::
   ::
    
     \P.some x.((dog x) and (P x))

As a point of interest, we have used a different style of variable in
sem7_, that is ``P`` rather than ``x`` or ``y``. This is to signal
that we are abstracting over a different kind of thing |mdash| not an
individual, but a unary predicate expression. 

We are pretty much done now, except that we also want to carry out a
further abstraction plus application for the process of combining the
semantics of the determiner `a`:lx: with the semantics of `dog`:lx:.
Applying sem7_ as a functor to ``bark`` gives us ``(\P.some x.((dog
x) and (P x)) bark)``, and carrying out |beta|\-reduction gives us
just what we wanted, namely sem5b_.

|NLTK| provides some utilities to make it easier to derive and inspect
semantic interpretations. ``text_interpret`` is intended for batch
interpretation of a list of input sentences. It builds a dictionary
``d`` where for each sentence ``sent`` in the input,
``d[sent]`` is a list of paired trees and semantic representations for
``sent``. The value is a list, since ``sent`` may be syntactically
ambiguous; in the following example, we just look at the first member
of the list.

   >>> from nltk_lite.semantics import *
   >>> grammar = GrammarFile.read_file('sem1.cfg')
   >>> result  = text_interpret(['a dog barks'], grammar, beta_reduce=0)
   >>> (syntree, semrep) = result['a dog barks'][0]
   >>> print syntree
   ([INIT][]:
     (S[ sem = ApplicationExpression('(\Q P.some x.(and (Q x) (P x)) dog)', 'bark') ]:
       (NP[ sem = ApplicationExpression('\Q P.some x.(and (Q x) (P x))', 'dog') ]:
	 (Det[ sem = LambdaExpression('Q', '\P.some x.(and (Q x) (P x))') ]: 'a')
	 (N[ sem = VariableExpression('dog') ]: 'dog'))
       (VP[ sem = VariableExpression('bark') ]:
	 (IV[ sem = VariableExpression('bark') ]: 'barks'))))
   >>> print semrep
   some x.(and (dog x) (bark x))
   >>> 

By default, the semantic representation that is produced by
``text_interpret`` has already undergone |beta|-reduction, but in the
above example, we have overriden this.
Subsequent reduction is possible 
using the ``simplify`` method, and Boolean connectives can be placed
in infix position with the ``infixify`` method.

   >>> print semrep.simplify()
   some x.(and (dog x) (bark x))
   >>> print semrep.simplify().infixify()
   some x.((dog x) and (bark x))


Our next challenge is to deal with sentences containing transitive
verbs, such as sem8_.

.. _sem8: 
.. ex::

     Suzie chases a dog.

The output semantics that we want to build is shown in sem9_.

.. _sem9: 
.. ex::
   :: 

     some x.((dog x) and (chase x suzie))

Let's look at how we can use |lambda|-abstraction to get this
result. A significant constraint on possible solutions is to require
that the semantic representation of `a dog`:lx: be independent of
whether the `NP`:gc: acts as subject or object of the sentence. In
other words, we want to get sem9_ as our output while sticking to
sem7_ as the `NP`:gc: semantics. A second constraint is that
`VP`:gc:\s should have the uniform type of interpretation regardless
of whether they consist of just an intransitive verb or a transitive
verb plus object. More specifically, we will stipulate that `VP`:gc:\s
always denote characteristic functions on individuals. Given these
constraints, here's a semantic representation for `chases a dog`:lx:
which does the trick.

.. _sem99: 
.. ex::
   :: 

    \y.some x.((dog x) and (chase x y))

Think of sem99_ as the property of being a `y`:mathit: such that
for some dog `x`:mathit:, `y`:mathit: chases `x`:mathit:; or more
colloquially, being a `y`:mathit: who chases a dog. Our task now
resolves to designing a semantic representation for
`chases`:lx: which can combine via ``app`` with sem7_ so as to allow
sem99_ to be derived. Let ``X`` stand for sem7_. Then we are part
way to the solution if we can derive sem10_, where ``X`` is applied to
``\z.(chase z y)``.

.. _sem10: 
.. ex::
   ::

   (X \z.(chase z y))

sem10_ is equivalent to sem11_, which reduces to sem99_.

.. _sem11: 
.. ex::
   ::

    (\P.some x.((dog x) and (P x)) \z.(chase z y))

The full solution is reached by giving `chases`:lx: the semantic
representation shown in sem12_.

.. _sem12: 
.. ex::
   ::

    \X y.(X \x.(chase x y))

If sem12_ is applied to sem7_, the result after |beta|-reduction is
equivalent to sem99_, which is what we wanted all along. 

In order to build a semantic representation for a sentence, we also
need to combine in the semantics of the subject `NP`:gc:. If the
latter is a quantified expression like `every girl`:lx:, everything
proceeds in the same way as we showed for `a dog barks`:lx: earlier
on; the subject is translated as a functor which is applied to the
semantic representation of the `VP`:gc:.  However, we now seem to have
created another problem for ourselves with proper names. So far, these
have been treated semanntically as individual constants, and these
cannot be applied as functors to expressions like
sem99_. Consequently, we need to come up with a different semantic
representation for them. What we do
in this case is re-intepret proper names so that they too are
functors, like quantified `NP`:gc:\ s. sem13_ shows the required
|lambda| expression for `Suzie`:lx:.

.. _sem13: 
.. ex::
   ::

    \P.(P suzie)

sem13_ denotes the characteristic function corresponding to the set of
all properties which are true of Suzie. Converting from an individual
constant to an expression like sem12_ is known as `type raising`:dt:,
and allows us to flip functors with arguments. That is, type raising
means that we can replace a Boolean-valued application such as `(f
a)`:mathit: with an equivalent application `(`:math:\ |lambda|\ `P.(P a)
f)`:mathit:.


One important limitation of the approach we have presented here is
that it does not attempt to deal with scope ambiguity. Instead,
quantifier scope ordering directly reflects scope in the parse
tree. As a result, a sentence like scope1_, repeated here, will always
be translated as scope12a_, not scope12b_.

.. _scope11:
.. ex:: Every girl chases a dog.

.. _scope12:
.. ex::

   .. _scope12a:
   .. ex::
      :: 

       all x. ((girl x) implies some y. ((dog y) and (chase y x)))

   .. _scope12b:
   .. ex::  
      :: 

       some y. (dog y) and all x. ((girl x) implies (chase y x)))

This limitation can be overcome, for example using the hole semantics
described in Blackburn and Bos, but discussing the details would take
us outside the scope of the current chapter.

Now that we have looked at some slightly more complex constructions, we can
evaluate them in a model. In the following example, we derive two
parses for the sentence `every boy chases a girl in Noosa`:lx:, and
evaluate each of the corresponding semantic representations in the
model ``model0.py`` which we have imported.

   >>> from nltk_lite.semantics import *
   >>> from model0.py import *
   >>> grammar = GrammarFile.read_file('sem2.cfg')
   >>> sent = 'every boy chases a girl in Noosa'
   >>> result = text_evaluate([sent], grammar, m, g)
   >>> for (syntree, semrep, value) in result[sent]:
   ... 	print "'%s' is %s in Model m\n" % (semrep.infixify(), value)
   ... 
   'all x.((boy x) implies (some z4.((girl z4) and (chase z4 x)) and 
   (in noosa x)))' is True in Model m
   ...
   'all x.((boy x) implies some z5.(((girl z5) and (in noosa z5)) and
   (chase z5 x)))' is False in Model m
