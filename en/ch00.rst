|nopar|
This is a book about `Natural Language Processing`:dt:. By `natural
language`:dt: we mean a language that is used for everyday
communication by humans; languages like English, Hindi or
Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as
programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have
evolved as they pass from generation to generation, and are hard to
pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing (or |NLP|
for short) in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation
of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting
the number of times the letter `t` occurs in a paragraph of text. At
the other extreme, |NLP| involves "understanding" complete human
utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful
responses to them.  

Technologies based on |NLP|
are becoming increasingly widespread. For example, phones and handheld computers
support predictive text and handwriting recognition;  web
search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured
text; machine translation allows us to retrieve texts written in
Chinese and read them in Spanish.  By providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more
sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has
come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of |NLP|.
It can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course
on natural language processing or computational linguistics.
The book is intensely practical, containing 
hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises.
It is based on the Python programming language together with an open source
library called the *Natural Language Toolkit* (|NLTK|).
|NLTK| includes software, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from |NLTK-URL|.
Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh and Unix platforms.
We encourage you, the reader, to download Python and |NLTK|, and try out the
examples and exercises along the way.

--------
Audience
--------

|NLP| is important for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons.
|NLP| is experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in
a variety of new language technologies.  For this reason it is
important for a wide range of people to have a working knowledge of |NLP|.
Within industry, it includes people in
`human-computer interaction`:idx:, `business information analysis`:idx:,
and `Web software development`:idx:.
Within academia, this includes people in areas from
`humanities computing`:idx: and `corpus linguistics`:idx:
through to `computer science`:idx: and `artificial intelligence`:idx:.

This book is intended for a diverse range of people who want to
learn how to write programs that analyze written language:

:New to Programming?:  The book is suitable for readers with no prior
    knowledge of programming, and the early chapters contain many examples that
    you can simply copy and try for yourself, together with graded exercises.
    If you decide you need a more general introduction to Python, we recommend
    you read *Learning Python* (O'Reilly) in conjunction with this book.

:New to Python?:  Experienced programmers can quickly learn enough
    Python using this book to get immersed in natural language processing.
    All relevant Python features are carefully explained and exemplified,
    and you will quickly come to appreciate Python's suitability for this
    application area.

:Already dreaming in Python?:  Skip the Python examples
    and dig into the interesting language analysis
    material that starts in Chapter chap-introduction_.  Soon you'll
    be applying your skills to this exciting new application area.

--------
Emphasis
--------

This book is a **practical** introduction to |NLP|.  You will learn by
example, write real programs, and grasp the value of being able to
test an idea through implementation.  If you haven't learnt already,
this book will teach you **programming**.  Unlike other programming
books, we provide extensive illustrations and exercises from |NLP|.  The
approach we have taken is also **principled**, in that we cover the
theoretical underpinnings and don't shy away from careful linguistic
and computational analysis.  We have tried to be **pragmatic** in
striking a balance between theory and application, identifying the
connections and the tensions.  Finally, we recognize that you
won't get through this unless it is also **pleasurable**, so we have
tried to include many applications and examples that are interesting
and entertaining, sometimes whimsical.

-------------------
What You Will Learn
-------------------

By digging into the material presented here, you will learn:

* how simple programs can help you manipulate and analyze
  language data, and how to write these programs;
* how key concepts from |NLP| and linguistics are used to describe and
  analyse language;
* how data structures and algorithms are used in |NLP|;
* how language data is stored in standard formats, and how data can
  be used to evaluate the performance of |NLP| techniques.

Depending on your background, and your motivation for being interested in |NLP|,
you will gain different kinds of skills and knowledge from this book, as set out
in Table goals_.

------------
Organization
------------

The early chapters are organized in order of conceptual difficulty,
starting with a practical introduction to language processing
that shows how to explore interesting bodies of text using
tiny Python programs (Chapters 1 and 2).  After this the pace picks up,
and we move
onto a series of chapters covering fundamental topics in
language processing, topics we think all readers should attempt (Chapters 3-5).
At the halfway point there is a chapter on structured programming
(Chapter 6) which consolidates the
programming topics scattered across the preceding chapters.
The next four chapters look at sentence structure from various angles,
including how to extract information (Chapter 7), build syntactic structure
(Chapter 8 and 9), and access meaning (Chapter 10).
The penultimate chapter is devoted to linguistic data and how it can
be managed effectively (Chapter 11).  We conclude with a discussion of
the past and future of the field (Chapter 12).  There follows a series
of appendixes containing reference material and coverage of specialized
topics.

Within each chapter, we switch between different styles of presentation.
In one style, natural language is the driver.  We analyze language,
explore linguistic concepts, and use programming examples to support
the discussion.  We often employ Python constructs that have
not been introduced systematically, so you can see their purpose
before delving into the details of how and why they work.
This is just like learning idiomatic expressions in a foreign language:
you're able to buy a nice pastry without first having learnt
the intricacies of question formation.
In the other style of presentation, the programming language will be the driver.
We'll analyze programs, explore algorithms, and the linguistic examples
will play a supporting role.

Chapters 2-11 end with a series of graded exercises,
which are useful for consolidating the material.
The exercises are graded according to the following scheme:
|easy| is for easy exercises that involve minor modifications
to supplied code samples or other simple activities;
|soso| is for intermediate exercises that explore an aspect
of the material in more depth, requiring careful analysis and design;
|hard| is for difficult, open-ended tasks that will challenge your
understanding of the material and force you to think independently
(readers new to programming should skip these);
|talk| is for non-programming exercises for reflection or discussion. 

-----------
Why Python?
-----------

Python is a simple yet powerful programming language with excellent
functionality for processing linguistic data.  Python can be
downloaded for free from `http://www.python.org/ <http://www.python.org/>`_.
Installers are available for all platforms.

Here is a five-line Python program that processes ``file.txt``
and prints all the words ending in ``ing``:

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> for line in open("file.txt"):      # for each line of the text file
    ...     for word in line.split():      # for each word in the line
    ...         if word.endswith('ing'):   # does the word end in 'ing'?
    ...             print word             # if so, print the word

This program illustrates some of the main features of Python.  First,
whitespace is used to *nest* lines of code, thus the line starting
with ``if`` falls inside the scope of the previous line starting with
``for``; this ensures that the ``ing`` test is performed for each
word.  Second, Python is *object-oriented*; each variable is an entity
that has certain defined attributes and methods.  For example, the
value of the variable ``line`` is more than a sequence of characters.
It is a string object that has a `method`:dt: (or operation) called
``split()`` that we can use to break a line into its words.  To apply
a method to an object, we write the object name, followed by a period,
followed by the method name; i.e., ``line.split()``.  Third, methods
have *parameters* expressed inside parentheses.  For instance, in the
example above, ``word.endswith('ing')`` had the parameter ``'ing'`` to
indicate that we wanted words ending with `ing`:lx: and not something else. 
Finally |mdash| and most importantly |mdash|
Python is highly readable, so much so that it is fairly easy to guess
what the above program does even if you have never written a program
before.

We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve,
its syntax and semantics are transparent,
and it has good string-handling functionality.  As a scripting
language, Python facilitates interactive exploration.  As an
object-oriented language, Python permits data and methods to be
encapsulated and re-used easily.  As a dynamic language, Python
permits attributes to be added to objects on the fly, and permits
variables to be typed dynamically, facilitating rapid development.
Python comes with an extensive
standard library, including components for graphical programming,
numerical processing, and web data processing.

Python is heavily used in industry, scientific research, and education
around the world.  Python is often praised for the way it facilitates
productivity, quality, and maintainability of software.  A collection of
Python success stories is posted at
`http://www.python.org/about/success/ <http://www.python.org/about/success/>`_.

|NLTK| defines an infrastructure that can be used to build |NLP|
programs in Python.  It provides
basic classes for representing data relevant to natural language processing;
standard interfaces for performing tasks such as tokenization,
part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing;
and standard implementations for each task which can be combined to solve complex problems.

|NLTK| comes with extensive documentation. In addition to this 
book, the website |NLTK-URL| provides API documentation
which covers every module, class and function in the toolkit,
specifying parameters and giving examples of usage. 
The website also provides many HOWTOs with extensive
examples and test cases, intended for users, developers and instructors.

-----------------------------------------------
Learning Python for Natural Language Processing
-----------------------------------------------

This book contains self-paced learning materials including many examples and exercises.
An effective way to learn is simply to work through the materials.
The program fragments can be copied directly into a Python interactive session.
Any questions concerning the book, or Python and |NLP| more generally,
can be posted to the NLTK-Users mailing list (see |NLTK-URL|).

:Python Environments:
  The easiest way to start developing Python code, and to run interactive Python
  demonstrations, is to use the simple
  editor and interpreter GUI that comes with Python called *IDLE*, the *Integrated
  DeveLopment Environment for Python*.

:NLTK Community:
  |NLTK| has a large and growing user base.  There are mailing lists for
  announcements about |NLTK|, for developers and for teachers.
  |NLTK-URL| lists many courses around the world where |NLTK|
  and materials from this book have been adopted,
  a useful source of extra materials including slides and exercises.

------------------
The Design of NLTK
------------------

|NLTK| was designed with four primary goals in mind:

:Simplicity: We have tried to provide an intuitive and appealing
    framework along with substantial building blocks, so you can gain
    a practical knowledge of |NLP| without getting bogged down in the
    tedious house-keeping usually associated with processing annotated
    language data.  We have provided software distributions for
    several platforms, along with platform-specific instructions, to
    make the toolkit easy to install.
:Consistency: We have made a significant effort to ensure that all the
    data structures and interfaces are consistent, making it easy to
    carry out a variety of tasks using a uniform framework.
:Extensibility: The toolkit easily accommodates new components,
    whether those components replicate or extend existing functionality.
    Moreover, the toolkit is organized so that it is usually obvious where
    extensions would fit into the toolkit's infrastructure.
:Modularity: The interaction between different components of the
    toolkit uses simple, well-defined interfaces.  It is possible to
    complete individual projects using small parts of the toolkit,
    without needing to understand how they interact with the rest of
    the toolkit.  Modularity also makes it easier
    to change and extend the toolkit.

..
    :Well-Documented: The toolkit comes with substantial documentation,
       including nomenclature, data structures, and implementations.

Contrasting with these goals are three non-requirements |mdash|
potentially useful features that we have deliberately avoided.  First,
while the toolkit provides a wide range of functions, it is not
encyclopedic; it will continue to evolve with the field of |NLP|. 
Second, while the toolkit should be efficient enough to
support meaningful tasks, it does not need to be highly optimized for
runtime performance; such optimizations often involve more complex
algorithms, and sometimes require the use of programming languages
like C or C++.  This would make the toolkit less accessible and more
difficult to install.  Third, we have tried to avoid clever
programming tricks, since clear implementations are preferable to
ingenious yet indecipherable ones.

---------------
For Instructors
---------------

Natural Language Processing (|NLP|) is often taught within the
confines of a single-semester course at advanced undergraduate level
or postgraduate level.  Many instructors have found that it is
difficult to cover both the theoretical and practical sides of the
subject in such a short span of time.  Some courses focus on theory to
the exclusion of practical exercises, and deprive students of the
challenge and excitement of writing programs to automatically process
language.  Other courses are simply designed to teach programming for
linguists, and do not manage to cover any significant |NLP| content.
|NLTK| was originally developed to address this problem,
making it feasible to cover a substantial amount of theory and
practice within a single-semester course, even if students have no
prior programming experience.
    
A significant fraction of any |NLP| syllabus deals with
algorithms and data structures.  On their own these can be rather
dry, but |NLTK| brings them to life with the help of  
interactive graphical user interfaces making it possible
to view algorithms step-by-step.  Most |NLTK| components include
a demonstration which performs an interesting task without
requiring any special input from the user.
An effective way to deliver the materials is through interactive
presentation of the examples, entering them in a Python session,
observing what they do, and modifying them to explore some empirical
or theoretical issue.

The book contains hundreds of examples and exercises which can be used
as the basis for student assignments.  The simplest exercises involve
modifying a supplied program fragment in a specified way in order to
answer a concrete question.  At the other end of the spectrum, |NLTK|
provides a flexible framework for graduate-level research projects,
with standard implementations of all the basic data structures
and algorithms, interfaces to dozens of widely used data-sets (corpora),
and a flexible and extensible architecture.  Additional support for
teaching using |NLTK| is available on the |NLTK| website, and on a
closed mailing list for instructors.

|nopar|  
We believe this book is unique in providing a comprehensive
framework for students to learn about |NLP| in the context of learning
to program.  What sets these
materials apart is the tight coupling of the chapters
and exercises with |NLTK|, giving students |mdash| even those with
no prior programming experience |mdash| a practical introduction to
|NLP|.  After completing these materials, students will be ready to
attempt one of the more advanced textbooks, such as *Speech and
Language Processing*, by Jurafsky and Martin (Prentice Hall, 2008).

This book presents programming concepts in an unusual order, beginning
with a non-trivial data type |mdash| lists of strings |mdash| before introducing
non-trivial control structures like comprehensions and conditionals.
These idioms permit us to do useful language processing from the start.
Once this motivation is in place we deal with the fundamental concepts
systematically.  Thus we cover the same ground as more conventional
approaches, without expecting readers to be interested in the programming
language for its own sake.
