Most human knowledge |mdash| and most human communication |mdash| is
represented and expressed using language.  Language technologies
permit computers to process human language automatically;  handheld
computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition;  web
search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured
text.  By providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more
sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has
come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.

This textbook provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the field of
natural language processing (|NLP|), covering the major techniques and
theories.  The book provides numerous worked examples and exercises,
and can either be used for self-study or as the main text for
undergraduate and introductory graduate courses on natural language
processing or computational linguistics.

--------
Audience
--------

This book is intended for people who want to learn how to write programs that
analyze written language.  It is accessible to people who are new to programming,
but structured in such a way that experienced programmers can quickly learn
important |NLP| techniques.

**New to Programming?**  The book is suitable for readers with no prior
knowledge of programming, and the early chapters contain many examples that
you can simply copy and try for yourself, together with graded exercises.
If you decide you need a more general introduction to Python, we recommend
you read *Learning Python* (O'Reilly) in conjunction with this book.

**New to Python?**  Experienced programmers can quickly learn enough
Python using this book to get immersed in natural language processing.
All relevant Python features are carefully explained and exemplified,
and you will quickly come to appreciate Python's suitability for this
application area.

**Already dreaming in Python?**  Simply skip the Python
introduction, and dig into the interesting language analysis
material that starts in the following chapter.  Soon you'll
be applying your skills to this exciting new application area.

-------------------

Download the Toolkit...
-----------------------

This textbook is a companion to the software library *Natural Language
Toolkit* (|NLTK|).  All
software, corpora, and documentation are freely downloadable from
|NLTK-URL|.  Distributions are provided for
Windows, Macintosh and Unix platforms.  All |NLTK| distributions plus
Python and WordNet distributions are also available in the form of an
ISO image which can be downloaded and burnt to CD-ROM for easy local
redistribution.  We strongly encourage you to download |NLTK|
before you go beyond the first chapter of the book.

--------
Emphasis
--------

This book is a **practical** introduction to |NLP|.  You will learn by
example, write real programs, and grasp the value of being able to
test an idea through implementation.  If you haven't learnt already,
this book will teach you **programming**.  Unlike other programming
books, we provide extensive illustrations and exercises from |NLP|.  The
approach we have taken is also **principled**, in that we cover the
theoretical underpinnings and don't shy away from careful linguistic
and computational analysis.  We have tried to be **pragmatic** in
striking a balance between theory and application, and alternate
between the two several times each chapter, identifying the
connections but also the tensions.  Finally, we recognize that you
won't get through this unless it is also **pleasurable**, so we have
tried to include many applications and examples that are interesting
and entertaining, sometimes whimsical.

---------
Structure
---------

The book is structured into three parts, as follows:

*Part 1: Basics* 
    In this part, we focus on recognising simple
    structure in text.  We start with individual words, then explore
    parts of speech and simple syntactic constituents.

*Part 2: Parsing* 
    Here, we deal with syntactic structure, trees, grammars, and
    parsing.


*Part 3: Advanced Topics* 
    This final part of the book contains chapters which address selected
    topics in |NLP| in more depth and to a more advanced level.
    By design, the chapters in this part can be read independently of
    each other.

|nopar|
The three parts have a common structure: they start off with a
chapter on programming, followed by three chapters on various topics in |NLP|.
The programming chapters are *foundational*, and you must master this
material before progressing further.

Each chapter consists of an introduction, a sequence of sections
that progress from elementary to advanced material,
and finally a summary and suggestions for further reading.
Most sections include exercises which are graded according to
the following scheme:
|easy| is for easy exercises that involve minor modifications
to supplied code samples or other simple activities;
|soso| is for intermediate exercises that explore an aspect
of the material in more depth, requiring careful
analysis and design;
|hard| is for difficult, open-ended tasks that will challenge
your understanding of the material and force you to think independently
(readers new to programming are encouraged to skip these).
The exercises are important for consolidating the
material in each section, and we strongly encourage you to try a few
before continuing with the rest of the chapter.

---------------
For Instructors
---------------

Natural Language Processing (|NLP|) is often taught within the
confines of a single-semester course at advanced undergraduate level
or postgraduate level.  Many instructors have found that it is
difficult to cover both the theoretical and practical sides of the
subject in such a short span of time.  Some courses focus on theory to
the exclusion of practical exercises, and deprive students of the
challenge and excitement of writing programs to automatically process
language.  Other courses are simply designed to teach programming for
linguists, and do not manage to cover any significant |NLP| content.
The *Natural Language Toolkit* (NLTK) was originally developed to address this problem,
making it feasible to cover a substantial amount of theory and
practice within a single-semester course, even if students have no
prior programming experience.
    
A significant fraction of any |NLP| syllabus covers fundamental
data structures and algorithms.  These are usually taught with the
help of formal notations and complex diagrams.  Large trees and charts
are copied onto the board and edited in tedious slow motion, or
laboriously prepared for presentation slides.  It is more effective
to use live demonstrations in which those diagrams are generated
and updated automatically.  NLTK provides interactive graphical user
interfaces, making it possible to view program state and to study
program execution step-by-step.  Most NLTK components have a
demonstration mode, and will perform an interesting task without
requiring any special input from the user.  It is even possible to
make minor modifications to programs in response to "what if"
questions.  In this way, students learn the mechanics of |NLP| quickly,
gain deeper insights into the data structures and algorithms, and
acquire new problem-solving skills.
    
NLTK supports assignments of varying difficulty and scope.  In the
simplest assignments, students experiment with existing components to
perform a wide variety of |NLP| tasks.  This may involve no programming
at all, in the case of the existing demonstrations, or simply changing
a line or two of program code.  As students become more familiar with
the toolkit they can be asked to modify existing components or to
create complete systems out of existing components.  NLTK also
provides students with a flexible framework for advanced projects,
such as developing a multi-component system, by integrating and
extending NLTK components, and adding on entirely new components.
Here NLTK helps by providing standard implementations of all the basic
data structures and algorithms, interfaces to standard corpora,
substantial corpus samples, and a flexible and extensible
architecture.  Thus, as we have seen, NLTK offers a fresh approach to
|NLP| pedagogy, in which theoretical content is tightly integrated with
application.

|nopar|  
We believe this book is unique in providing a comprehensive
framework for students to learn about |NLP| in the context of learning
to program.  What sets these
materials apart is the tight coupling of the chapters
and exercises with NLTK, giving students |mdash| even those with
no prior programming experience |mdash| a practical introduction to
|NLP|.  Once completing these materials, students will be ready to
attempt one of the more advanced textbooks, such as *Foundations of
Statistical Natural Language Processing*, by Manning and Schütze (MIT
Press, 2000).
