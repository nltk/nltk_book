This chapter introduces concepts in algorithms, data structures,
program design, and advanced Python programming. It also contains
review of the basic mathematical notions of set, relation, and
function, and illustrates them in terms of Python data structures.
It contains many working program fragments which you should try yourself.

Iterators
---------

Generating all permutations of words, to check which ones are
grammatical:

    >>> def perms(seq):
    ...     if len(seq) <=1:
    ...         yield seq
    ...     else:
    ...         for perm in perms(seq[1:]):
    ...             for i in range(len(perm)+1):
    ...                 yield perm[:i] + seq[0:1] + perm[i:]
    >>> list(perms(['police', 'fish', 'cream']))
    [['police', 'fish', 'cream'], ['fish', 'police', 'cream'],
     ['fish', 'cream', 'police'], ['police', 'cream', 'fish'],
     ['cream', 'police', 'fish'], ['cream', 'fish', 'police']]


-------------------------------------
Object-Oriented Programming in Python
-------------------------------------

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm in which
complex structures and processes are decomposed into modules,
each encapsulating a single data type and the legal operations on
that type.

Data Classes: Trees in NLTK
---------------------------

An important data type in language processing is the syntactic tree.
Here we will review the parts of the NLTK code which defines the ``Tree``
class.  

The first line of a class definition is the ``class`` keyword followed
by the class name, in this case ``Tree``.  This class is derived from
Python's built-in ``list`` class, permitting us to use standard list
operations to access the children of a tree node.

    >>> class Tree(list):

Next we define the initializer, also known as the `constructor`:lx:.
It has a special name, starting and ending with double underscores;
Python knows to call this function when you asks for a new tree object
by writing ``t = Tree(node, children)``.  The constructor's first argument
is special, and is standardly called ``self``, giving us a way to
refer to the current object from inside the definition.  This
constructor calls the list initializer (similar to calling ``self =
list(children)``), then defines the ``node`` property of a tree.

.. doctest-ignore::
    ...     def __init__(self, node, children):
    ...         list.__init__(self, children)
    ...         self.node = node

Next we define another special function that Python knows to call when
we index a Tree.  The first case is the simplest, when the index is an
integer, e.g. ``t[2]``, we just ask for the list item in the obvious
way.  The other cases are for handling slices, like ``t[1:2]``, or ``t[:]``.

.. doctest-ignore::
    ...     def __getitem__(self, index):
    ...         if isinstance(index, int):
    ...             return list.__getitem__(self, index)
    ...         else:
    ...             if len(index) == 0:
    ...                 return self
    ...             elif len(index) == 1:
    ...                 return self[int(index[0])]
    ...             else:
    ...                 return self[int(index[0])][index[1:]]
    ...     

.. SB: what is the len(index) == 0 case for???

This method was for accessing a child node.  Similar methods are
provided for setting and deleting a child (using ``__setitem__``)
and ``__delitem__``).

Two other special member functions are ``__repr__()`` and ``__str__()``.
The ``__repr__()`` function produces a string representation of the
object, one which can be executed to re-create the object, and is
accessed from the interpreter simply by typing the name of the object
and pressing 'enter'.  The ``__str__()`` function produces a human-readable
version of the object; here we call a pretty-printing function we have
defined called ``pp()``.

.. doctest-ignore::
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         childstr = ' '.join([repr(c) for c in self])
    ...         return '(%s: %s)' % (self.node, childstr)
    ...     def __str__(self):
    ...         return self.pp()


Next we define some member functions that do other standard operations
on trees.  First, for accessing the leaves:

.. doctest-ignore::
    ...     def leaves(self):
    ...         leaves = []
    ...         for child in self:
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 leaves.extend(child.leaves())
    ...             else:
    ...                 leaves.append(child)
    ...         return leaves


Next, for computing the height:

.. doctest-ignore::
    ...     def height(self):
    ...         max_child_height = 0
    ...         for child in self:
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 max_child_height = max(max_child_height, child.height())
    ...             else:
    ...                 max_child_height = max(max_child_height, 1)
    ...         return 1 + max_child_height

And finally, for enumerating all the subtrees (optionally filtered):

.. doctest-ignore::
    ...     def subtrees(self, filter=None):
    ...         if not filter or filter(self):
    ...             yield self
    ...         for child in self:
    ...             if isinstance(child, Tree):
    ...                 for subtree in child.subtrees(filter):
    ...                     yield subtree


Processing Classes: N-gram Taggers in NLTK
------------------------------------------

This section will discuss the ``tag.ngram`` module.


----------------
Algorithm Design
----------------

An *algorithm* is a "recipe" for solving a problem.  For example,
to multiply 16 by 12 we might use any of the following methods:

1. Add 16 to itself 12 times over
#. Perform "long multiplication", starting with the least-significant
   digits of both numbers
#. Look up a multiplication table
#. Repeatedly halve the first number and double the second,
   16*12 = 8*24 = 4*48 = 2*96 = 192
#. Do 10*12 to get 120, then add 6*12

Each of these methods is a different algorithm, and requires different
amounts of computation time and different amounts of intermediate
information to store.  A similar situation holds for many other
superficially simple tasks, such as sorting a list of words.  Now, as
we saw above, Python provides a built-in function ``sort()`` that
performs this task efficiently.  However, NLTK-Lite also provides
several algorithms for sorting lists, to illustrate the variety of
possible methods.  To illustrate the difference in efficiency, we
will create a list of 1000 numbers, randomize the list, then sort it,
counting the number of list manipulations required.

  >>> from random import shuffle
  >>> a = range(1000)                     # [0,1,2,...999]
  >>> shuffle(a)                          # randomize

Now we can try a simple sort method called *bubble sort*, which
scans through the list many times, exchanging adjacent items if
they are out of order.  It sorts the list ``a`` in-place, and returns
the number of times it modified the list:

  >>> from nltk_lite.misc import sort
  >>> sort.bubble(a)
  250918

We can try the same task using various sorting algorithms.  Evidently
*merge sort* is much better than bubble sort, and *quicksort* is better still.

  >>> shuffle(a); sort.merge(a)
  6175
  >>> shuffle(a); sort.quick(a)
  2378

Readers are encouraged to look at ``nltk_lite.misc.sort`` to see how
these different methods work.  The collection of NLTK-Lite modules
exemplify a variety of algorithm design techniques, including
brute-force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy search.
Readers who would like a systematic introduction to algorithm design
should consult the resources mentioned at the end of this tutorial.

Exercises
---------

1. Consider again the problem of hyphenation across linebreaks.
   Suppose that you have successfully written a tokenizer that
   returns a list of strings, where some strings may contain
   a hyphen followed by a newline character, e.g. ``long-\nterm``.
   Write a function which iterates over the tokens in a list,
   removing the newline character from each, in each of the following
   ways:

   a) Use doubly-nested for loops.  The outer loop will iterate over
      each token in the list, while the inner loop will iterate over
      each character of a string.

   b) Replace the inner loop with a call to ``re.sub()``

   c) Finally, replace the outer loop with call to the ``map()``
      function, to apply this substitution to each token.

   d) Discuss the clarity (or otherwise) of each of these approaches.

2. Develop a simple extractive summarization tool, which prints the
   sentences of a document which contain the highest total word
   frequency.  Use ``FreqDist`` to count word frequencies, and use
   ``sum`` to sum the frequencies of the words in each sentence.
   Rank the sentences according to their score.  Finally, print the *n*
   highest-scoring sentences in document order.  Carefully review the
   design of your program, especially your approach to this double
   sorting.  Make sure the program is written as clearly as possible.

-------------------------------
Sets and Mathematical Functions
-------------------------------

Sets
----

Knowing a bit about sets will come in useful when you look at 
|SemanticInterpretation|.
A set is a collection of entities, called the `members`:dt: of the
set. Sets can be finite or infinite, or even empty.
In Python, we can define a set just by listing its members; the
notation is similar to specifying a list:

    >>> set1 = set(['a', 'b', 1, 2, 3])
    >>> set1
    set(['a', 1, 2, 'b', 3])

|nopar|
In mathematical notation, we would specify this set as:

.. ex:: {'a', 'b', 1, 2, 3}

Set membership is a relation |mdash| we can ask whether some entity
`x`:math: belongs to a set `A`:math: (in mathematical notation,
written `x`:math: |element| `A`:math:).

    >>> 'a' in set1
    True
    >>> 'c' in set1
    False

|nopar|
However, sets differ from lists in that they are `unordered`:em: collections.
Two sets are equal if and only if they have exactly the same members:

    >>> set2 = set([3, 2, 1, 'b', 'a'])
    >>> set1 == set2
    True

The `cardinality`:dt: of a set `A`:math: (written |pipe|\ `A`:math:\
|pipe|) is the number of members in `A`:math:. We can get this value
using the ``len()`` function:

    >>> len(set1)
    5

The argument to the ``set()`` constructor can be any sequence, including
a string, and just calling the constructor with no argument creates
the empty set (written |empty|).

    >>> set('123')
    set(['1', '3', '2'])
    >>> a = set()
    >>> b = set()
    >>> a == b
    True


We can construct new sets out of old ones. The `union`:dt: of two sets
`A`:math: and `B`:math: (written `A`:math: |union| `B`:math:) is the set
of elements which belong to `A`:math: or `B`:math:. Union is
represented in Python with ``|``:

    >>> odds = set('13579')
    >>> evens = set('02468')
    >>> numbers = odds | evens
    >>> numbers
    set(['1', '0', '3', '2', '5', '4', '7', '6', '9', '8'])

The `intersection`:dt: of two sets `A`:math: and `B`:math: (written
`A`:math: |intersect| `B`:math:) is the set of elements which belong
to both `A`:math: and `B`:math:. Intersection is represented in Python
with ``&``. If the intersection of two sets is empty, they are said to
be `disjoint`:dt:.

    >>> ints
    set(['1', '0', '2', '-1', '-2'])
    >>> ints & nats
    set(['1', '0', '2'])
    >>> odds & evens
    set([])

The `(relative) complement`:dt: of two sets `A`:math: and `B`:math: (written 
`A`:math: |diff| `B`:math:)  is the set of
elements which belong to `A`:math: but not `B`:math:. Complement is represented
in Python with ``-``. 

    >>> nats - ints
    set(['3', '5', '4', '7', '6', '9', '8'])
    >>> odds == nats - evens
    True
    >>> odds == odds - set()
    True

So far, we have described how to define 'basic' sets and how to form
new sets out of those basic ones. All the basic sets have been
specified by listing all their members. Often we want to specify set
membership more succinctly:

.. _set1:
.. ex:: the set of positive integers less than 10

.. _set2:
.. ex:: the set of people in Melbourne with red hair

|nopar| 
We can informally write these sets using the
following `predicate notation`:dt:\ :

.. _set3:
.. ex:: {`x`:math: | `x`:math: is a positive integer less than 10}

.. _set4:
.. ex:: {`x`:math: | `x`:math: is a person in Melbourne with red hair}

In axiomatic set theory, the axiom schema of comprehension states that
given a one-place predicate `P`:math:, there is set `A`:math: such
that for all `x`:math:, `x`:math: belongs to `A`:math: if and only if
(written |iff|) `P(x)`:math: is true:

.. _compax:
.. ex:: |exists|\ `A`:math:\ |forall|\ `x`:math:.(`x`:math: |element|
        `A`:math: |iff| `P(x)`:math:\ )

|nopar| 
From a computational point of view, compax_ is
problematic: we have to treat sets as finite objects in the computer,
but there is nothing to stop us defining infinite sets using
comprehension. Now, there is a variant of compax_, called the axiom of
restricted comprehension, which allows us to specify a set `A`:math:
with a predicate `P`:math: so long as we only consider `x`:math:\ s
which belong to some `already defined set`:em: `B`:math:\:

.. _comprax:
.. ex:: |forall|\ `B`:math: |exists|\ `A`:math:\ |forall|\ `x`:math:.
        (`x`:math: |element| `A`:math: |iff| `x`:math: |element|
	`B`:math: |wedge|  `P(x)`:math:\ )

|nopar| (For all sets `B`:math: there is a set `A`:math: such that for all
`x`:math:, `x`:math: belongs to `A`:math: if and only if `x`:math:
belongs to `B`:math: and `P(x)`:math: is true.)
This is equivalent to the following set in predicate notation:

.. ex:: {`x`:math: | `x`:math: |element| `B`:math: |wedge| `P(x)`:math:\ )

|nopar|
comprax_ corresponds pretty much to what we get with list
comprehension in Python: if you already have a list, then you can
define a new list in terms of the old one, using an ``if``
condition. In other words, listcomp_ is the Python counterpart of
comprax_.

.. _listcomp:
.. ex:: ``set([x for x in B if P(x)])``

To illustrate this further, the following list comprehension relies on
the existence of the previously defined set ``nats`` (``n % 2`` is the
remainder when ``n`` is divided by ``2``):

   >>> nats = set(range(10))
   >>> evens1 = set([n for n in nats if n % 2 == 0])
   >>> evens1
   set([0, 8, 2, 4, 6])

|nopar| Now, when we defined ``evens`` before, what we actually had
was a set of `strings`:em:, rather than Python integers. But we can
use ``int`` to coerce the strings to be of the right type:

   >>> evens2 = set([int(n) for n in evens])
   >>> evens1 == evens2
   True

If every member of `A`:math: is also a member of `B`:math:, we say
that `A`:math: is a subset of `B`:math: (written `A`:math: |subset|
`B`:math:). The subset relation is represented
in Python with ``<=``. 

    >>> evens1 <= nats
    True
    >>> set() <= nats
    True
    >>> evens1 <= evens1
    True

As the above examples show, `B`:math: can contain more members than
`A`:math: for `A`:math: |subset|
`B`:math: to hold, but this need not be so. Every set is a subset of
itself. To exclude the case where a set is a subset of itself, we use
the relation `proper subset`:dt: (written `A`:math: |propsubset|
`B`:math:). In Python, this relation is represented as ``<``.

    >>> evens1 < nats
    True
    >>> evens1 < evens1
    False

Sets can contain other sets. For instance, the set `A`:math: =
{{`a`:math:}, {`b`:math:} } contains the two singleton sets
{`a`:math:} and {`b`:math:}. Note that {`a`:math:} |subset| `A`:math:
does not hold, since `a`:math: belongs to {`a`:math:} but not
to `A`:math:. In Python, it is a bit more awkward to specify sets
whose members are also sets; the latter have to be defined as
``frozenset``\ s, i.e., immutable objects.

    >>> a = frozenset('a')
    >>> aplus = set([a])
    >>> aplus
    set([frozenset(['a'])])

We also need to be careful to distinguish between the empty set |empty| and
the set whose only member is the empty set: {|empty|}.

Exercises
---------

1. For each of the following sets, write a specification by hand in
   predicate notation, and an implementation in Python using list
   comprehension.

   a. {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}

   b. {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}

   c. {0, 2, -2, 4, -4, 6, -6, 8, -8}

   

#. The `powerset`:dt: of a set `A`:math: (written |power|\ `A`:math:\ ) is
   the set of all subsets of `A`:math:, including the empty set. List
   the members of the following sets:

   a.  |power|\ {`a`:math:, `b`:math:, `c`:math:\ }:

   b.  |power|\ {`a`:math:\ }

   c.  |power|\ {|empty|}

   d.  |power|\ |empty|

#. Write a Python function to compute the powerset of an arbitrary
   set. Remember that you will have to use ``frozenset`` for this.


Tuples
------

We write |langle|\ `x`:math:\ :sub:`1`, |dots|\ , `x`:math:\ :sub:`n`\
|rangle| for the `ordered n-tuple`:dt: of objects 
`x`:math:\ :sub:`1`, |dots|\ , `x`:math:\ :sub:`n`, where `n`:math:
|geq| 0. These are exactly the same as Python tuples. Two tuples are
equal only if they have the same lengths, and the same objects in the
same order.

    >>> tup1 = ('a', 'b', 'c')
    >>> tup2 = ('a', 'c', 'b')
    >>> tup1 == tup2
    False

|nopar| A tuple with just 2 elements is called an `ordered pair`:dt:, with
just three elements, an `ordered triple`:dt:, and so on.

Given two sets `A`:math: and `B`:math:, we can form a set of ordered
pairs by drawing the first member of the pair from `A`:math: and the
second from `B`:math:. The `Cartesian product` of  `A`:math: and
`B`:math:, written `A`:math: |times| `B`:math:, is the set of all such
pairs. More generally, we have for any sets 
`S`:math:\ :sub:`1`, |dots|\ , `S`:math:\ :sub:`n`,

.. ex:: `S`:math:\ :sub:`1` |times| |dots| |times| `S`:math:\ :sub:`n` 
        = {|langle|\ `x`:math:\ :sub:`1`, |dots|\ , `x`:math:\ :sub:`n`\
        |rangle| |pipe| `x`:math:\ :sub:`i` |element| `S`:math:\ :sub:`i`}

In Python, we can build Cartesian products using list
comprehension. As you can see, the sets in a Cartesian product don't
have to be distinct.

    >>> A = set([1, 2, 3])
    >>> B = set('ab')
    >>> AxB = set([(a, b) for a in A for b in B])
    >>> AxB
    set([(1, 'b'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (1, 'a')])
    >>> AxA = set([(a1, a2) for a1 in A for a2 in A])
    >>> AxA
    set([(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (2, 1),
    (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1)])


.. mention S |sup|`n` ?

Relations and Functions
-----------------------

In general, a `relation`:dt: `R`:math: is a set of tuples. For
example, in set-theoretic terms, the binary relation `kiss`:lx:
is the set of all ordered pairs |langle|\ `x`:math:, `y`:math:\
|rangle| such that `x kisses y`:lx:. More formally, an `n-ary
relation`:dt: over sets `S`:math:\ :sub:`1`, |dots|\ , `S`:math:\
:sub:`n` is any set `R`:math: |subset| `S`:math:\ :sub:`1` |times|
|dots| |times| `S`:math:\ :sub:`n`.

Given a binary relation `R`:math: over two sets `A`:math: and
`B`:math:, not everything in `A`:math: need stand in the `R`:math:
relation to something in `B`:math:. As an illustration, consider the
set ``evens`` and the relation ``mod`` defined as follows:

    >>> evens = set([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
    >>> mod = set([(m,n) for m in evens for n in evens if n % m == 0 and m < n])
    >>> mod
    set([(4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 10)])

|nopar| Now, ``mod`` |subset| ``evens`` |times| ``evens``, but there
are elements of ``evens``, namely ``6``, ``8`` and ``10``, which do
not stand in the ``mod`` relation to anything else in ``evens``. In
this case, we say that only ``2`` and ``4`` are in the `domain`:dt: of
the ``mod`` relation. More formally, for a relation `R`:math: over
`A`:math: |times| `B`:math:, we define

.. ex::  `dom(R) = {x`:math: |pipe| |exists|\ `y.`:math:\
         |langle|\ `x`:math:, `y`:math:\ |rangle| |element|  
         `A`:math: |times| `B`:math:\ }
         
|nopar| Correspondingly, the set of entities in `B`:math: which are the second
member of a pair in `R`:math: is called the `range`:dt: of `R`:math:,
written `ran(R)`:math:.
 
We can visually represent the relation ``mod`` by drawing arrows to
indicate elements that stand in the relation, as shown in Figure modrel_.

.. _modrel:
.. figure:: ../images/mod_relation.png
   :scale: 30

   Visual Representation of a relation


|nopar| The domain and range of the relation are shown as shaded areas
in Figure modrel_.

.. 
   For sets `A`:math: and `B`:math:, a (set-theoretic) `function`:dt:
   from `A`:math: to `B`:math: is a relation `f`:math: |subset| `A`:math:
   |times| `B`:math: such that for every `a`:math: |element| `A`:math:
   there is at most one `b`:math: |element| `B`:math: such that |langle|\
   `a`:math:, `b`:math:\ |rangle|.
   Thus, the ``mod`` relation is not a function, since the element ``2``
   is paired with four items, not just one. By contrast, the relation
   ``addtwo`` defined as follows `is`:em: a function:

A relation `R`:math: |subset| `A`:math: |times| `B`:math: is a 
(set-theoretic) `function`:dt: just in case it meets the following
two conditions:

1. For every `a`:math: |element| `A`:math: there is at most one
   `b`:math: |element| `B`:math: such that |langle|\ `a`:math:,
   `b`:math:\ |rangle|.

2. The domain of  `R`:math: is equal to `A`:math:.


|nopar| Thus, the ``mod`` relation defined earlier is not a function, since
the element ``2`` is paired with four items, not just one. By
contrast, the relation ``doubles`` defined as follows `is`:em: a
function:

    >>> odds = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> doubles = set([(m,n) for m in odds for n in evens if n == m * 2])
    >>> doubles
    set([(1, 2), (5, 10), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8)])



If `f`:math: is a function |subset| `A`:math: |times| `B`:math:, then
we also say that `f`:math: is a function from `A`:math: to
`B`:math:. We also write this as `f`:math:\ : `A`:math: |mapsto|
`B`:math:. If |langle|\ `x`:math:, `y`:math:\ |rangle| |element|
`f`:math:, then we write `f(x) = y`:math:. Here, `x`:math: is called
an `argument`:dt: of `f`:math: and `y`:math: is a `value`:dt:. In such
a case, we may also say that `f`:math: maps `x`:math: to `y`:math:.

Given that functions always map a given argument to a single value, we
can also represent them in Python using dictionaries (which
incidentally are also known as `mapping`:dt: objects). The
``update()`` method on dictionaries can take as input any iterable of
key/value pairs, including sets of two-membered tuples:

    >>> d = {}
    >>> d.update(doubles)
    >>> d
    {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 8, 5: 10}


A function `f`:math:\ : `S`:math:\ :sub:`1` |times| |dots| |times|
`S`:math:\ :sub:`n` |mapsto| `T`:math: is called an `n-ary`:dt:
function; we usually write `f`:math:\ (`s`:math:\ :sub:`1`, |dots|,
`s`:math:\ :sub:`n`) rather than `f`:math:\ (|langle|\ `s`:math:\
:sub:`1`, |dots|, `s`:math:\ :sub:`n`\ |rangle|\ ). For sets `A`:math:
and `B`:math:, we write `A`:math:\ :sup:`B` for the set of all
functions from `A`:math: to `B`:math:, that is {`f`:math: |pipe| `f:
A`:math: |mapsto| `B`:math:}.
If `S`:math: is a set, then we can define a corresponding function
`f`:math:\ :sub:`S` called the `characteristic function`:dt: of
`S`:math:, defined as follows:

.. ex:: | `f`:math:\ :sub:`S`\ `(x)`:math: = True if `x`:math: |element| `S`:math:
	| `f`:math:\ :sub:`S`\ `(x)`:math: = False if `x`:math: |nelement| `S`:math:

|nopar| `f`:math:\ :sub:`S` is a member of the set {\ *True*, *False*\
}\ :sup:`S`.

It can happen that a relation meets condition (1) above but fails
condition (2); such relations are called `partial functions`:dt:. For
instance, let's slightly modify the definition of ``doubles``:

    >>> doubles2 = set([(m,n) for m in evens for n in evens if n == m * 2])
    >>> doubles2
    set([(2, 4), (4, 8)])

|nopar| ``doubles2`` is a partial function since its domain is a proper subset of
``evens``. In such a case, we say that ``doubles2`` is `defined`:dt:
for ``2`` and ``4`` but  `undefined`:dt: for the other elements in
``evens``.



Exercises
---------

1. Consider the relation ``doubles``, where ``evens`` is defined as in
   the text earlier:

     >>> doubles = set([(m,m*2) for m in evens])

   Is ``doubles`` a relation over ``evens``? Explain your answer.

#. What happens if you try to update a dictionary with a relation
   which is `not`:em: a function? 

#. Let `S`:math: be a family of three children, {Bart, Lisa,
   Maggie}. Define relations  `R`:math: |subset| `S`:math: |times| `S`:math:
   such that:

   a. `dom(R)`:math: |propsubset| `S`:math:;

   #. `dom(R)`:math: = `S`:math:;

   #. `ran(R)`:math: = `S`:math:;

   #. `ran(R)`:math: = `S`:math:;

   #. `R`:math: is a total function on `S`:math:.

   #. `R`:math: is a partial function on `S`:math:. 


   

#. Write a couple of Python functions which for any set of pairs `R`:math:,
   return the domain and range of `R`:math:.

#. Write a Python function which for any set of pairs `R`:math:,
   returns ``True`` if and only if `R`:math: is a function.
