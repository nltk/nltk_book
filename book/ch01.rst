=================================
1. Language Processing and Python
=================================

It is easy to get our hands on millions of words of text.
What can we do with it, assuming we can write some simple programs?
In this chapter we'll address the following questions:

#. What can we achieve by combining simple programming techniques with large quantities of text?
#. How can we automatically extract key words and phrases that sum up the style and content of a text?
#. What tools and techniques does the Python programming language provide for such work?
#. What are some of the interesting challenges of natural language processing?

This chapter is divided into sections that skip between two quite
different styles.  In the "computing with language" sections we will
take on some linguistically motivated programming tasks without necessarily
explaining how they work.  In the "closer look at Python" sections we
will systematically review key programming concepts.  We'll flag the two styles in the section titles,
but later chapters will mix both styles without being so up-front about it.
We hope this style of introduction gives you an
authentic taste of what will come later, while covering a range of
elementary concepts in linguistics and computer science.
If you have basic familiarity with both areas, you can skip to
sec-automatic-natural-language-understanding_;
we will repeat any important points in later chapters, and if you miss anything
you can easily consult the online reference material at |NLTK-URL|.
If the material is completely new to you, this chapter will raise
more questions than it answers, questions that are addressed in
the rest of this book.

Automatic Natural Language Understanding

We have been exploring language bottom-up, with the help of texts and
the Python programming
language.  However, we're also interested in exploiting our knowledge of language and computation
by building useful language technologies. We'll take the opportunity
now to step back from the nitty-gritty of code in order to paint a
bigger picture of natural language processing.

At a purely practical level, we all need help to navigate the universe of information
locked up in text on the Web.  Search engines have been crucial to the
growth and popularity of the Web, but have some shortcomings.
It takes skill, knowledge, and some luck,
to extract answers to such questions as: `What tourist sites can I
visit between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on a limited budget?`:lx:
`What do experts say about digital SLR cameras?`:lx: `What
predictions about the steel market were made by credible commentators
in the past week?`:lx: Getting a computer to answer them automatically
involves a range of language processing tasks, including information extraction,
inference, and summarization, and would need to be carried out on a scale
and with a level of robustness that is still beyond our current capabilities.

On a more philosophical level, a long-standing challenge within artificial intelligence
has been to build intelligent machines, and a major part of intelligent behaviour is understanding
language.  For many years this goal has been seen as too difficult.
However, as |NLP| technologies become more mature, and robust methods for
analyzing unrestricted text become more widespread, the prospect of
natural language understanding has re-emerged as a plausible goal.

In this section we describe some language understanding technologies,
to give you a sense of the interesting challenges that are waiting for you.

Word Sense Disambiguation
-------------------------

In `word sense disambiguation`:dt: we want to work out
which sense of a word was intended in a given context.  Consider the
ambiguous words `serve`:lx: and `dish`:lx:\ :

.. ex::
    .. ex:: `serve`:lx:\ : help with food or drink; hold an office; put ball into play
    .. ex:: `dish`:lx:\ : plate; course of a meal; communications device

In a sentence containing the phrase: `he served the dish`:lx:, you
can detect that both `serve`:lx: and `dish`:lx: are being used with
their food meanings.  It's unlikely that the topic of discussion
shifted from sports to crockery in the space of three words.
This would force you to invent bizarre images, like a tennis pro
taking out his or her frustrations on a china tea-set laid out beside the court. 
In other words, we automatically disambiguate words using context, exploiting
the simple fact that nearby words have closely related meanings.
As another example of this contextual effect, consider the word
`by`:lx:, which has several meanings, e.g.: `the book by
Chesterton`:lx: (agentive |mdash| Chesterton was the author of the book);
`the cup by the stove`:lx: (locative |mdash| the stove is where the
cup is); and `submit by Friday`:lx: (temporal |mdash| Friday is the
time of the submitting).
Observe in ex-lost-children_ that the meaning of the italicized word helps us
interpret the meaning of `by`:lx:.

.. _ex-lost-children:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The lost children were found by the `searchers`:em:  (agentive)
   .. ex:: The lost children were found by the `mountain`:em:   (locative)
   .. ex:: The lost children were found by the `afternoon`:em:  (temporal)

Pronoun Resolution
------------------

A deeper kind of language understanding is to work out "who did what to whom" |mdash|
i.e., to detect the subjects and objects of verbs.  You learnt to do this in
elementary school, but it's harder than you might think.
In the sentence `the thieves stole the paintings`:lx:
it is easy to tell who performed the stealing action.
Consider three possible following sentences in ex-thieves_, and try to determine
what was sold, caught, and found (one case is ambiguous).
  
.. _ex-thieves:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently `sold`:em:.
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently `caught`:em:.
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently `found`:em:.

Answering this question involves finding the `antecedent`:dt: of the pronoun `they`:lx:,
either thieves or paintings.  Computational techniques for tackling this problem
include `anaphora resolution`:dt: |mdash| identifying what a pronoun or noun phrase
refers to |mdash| and `semantic role labeling`:dt: |mdash| identifying how a noun phrase
relates to the verb (as agent, patient, instrument, and so on).

Generating Language Output
--------------------------

If we can automatically solve such problems of language understanding, we will
be able to move on to tasks that involve generating language output, such as
`question answering`:dt: and `machine translation`:dt:.  In the first case,
a machine should be able to answer a user's questions relating to collection of texts:

.. _ex-qa-application:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: *Text:* ... The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently sold. ...
   .. ex:: *Human:* Who or what was sold?
   .. ex:: *Machine:* The paintings.

The machine's answer demonstrates that it has correctly worked out that `they`:lx:
refers to paintings and not to thieves.  In the second case, the machine should
be able to translate the text into another language, accurately
conveying the meaning of the original text.  In translating the example text into French,
we are forced to choose the gender of the pronoun in the second sentence:
`ils`:lx: (masculine) if the thieves are found, and `elles`:lx: (feminine) if
the paintings are found.  Correct translation actually depends on correct understanding of
the pronoun.

.. _ex-mt-application:
.. ex::
   .. ex:: The thieves stole the paintings.  They were subsequently found.
   .. ex:: Les voleurs ont vol\ |eacute| les peintures. Ils ont |eacute|\ t\ |eacute| trouv\ |eacute|\ s plus tard.  (the thieves)
   .. ex:: Les voleurs ont vol\ |eacute| les peintures. Elles ont |eacute|\ t\ |eacute| trouv\ |eacute|\ es plus tard.  (the paintings)
    
In all of these examples, working out the sense of a word, the subject of a verb, and the 
antecedent of a pronoun are steps in establishing the meaning of a sentence, things
we would expect a language understanding system to be able to do.

Machine Translation
-------------------

For a long time now, machine translation (MT) has
been the holy grail of language understanding,
ultimately seeking to provide high-quality,
idiomatic translation between any pair of languages.
Its roots go back to the early days of the Cold War, when the promise
of automatic translation led to substantial government sponsorship,
and with it, the genesis of |NLP| itself.

Today, practical translation systems exist for particular pairs
of languages, and some are integrated into web search engines.
However, these systems have some serious shortcomings, which
are starkly revealed by translating a sentence back and forth
between a pair of languages until equilibrium is reached, e.g.:

| 0> how long before the next flight to Alice Springs?
| 1> wie lang vor dem folgenden Flug zu Alice Springs?
| 2> how long before the following flight to Alice jump?
| 3> wie lang vor dem folgenden Flug zu Alice springen Sie?
| 4> how long before the following flight to Alice do you jump?
| 5> wie lang, bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tun, Sie springen?
| 6> how long, before the following flight to Alice does, do you jump?
| 7> wie lang bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tut, tun Sie springen?
| 8> how long before the following flight to Alice does, do you jump?
| 9> wie lang, bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tut, tun Sie springen?
| 10> how long, before the following flight does to Alice, do do you jump?
| 11> wie lang bevor der folgende Flug zu Alice tut, Sie tun Sprung?
| 12> how long before the following flight does leap to Alice, does you?

Observe that the system correctly translates `Alice Springs`:lx: from English
to German (in the line starting ``1>``), but on the way back to English, this ends up as `Alice jump`:lx:
(line ``2``).  The preposition `before`:lx: is initially translated into the corresponding
German preposition `vor`:lx:, but later into the conjunction `bevor`:lx: (line 5).
After line ``5`` the sentences become nonsensical (but notice the various phrasings
indicated by the commas, and the change from `jump`:lx: to `leap`:lx:).
The translation system did not recognize when a word was part of a proper name,
and it misinterpreted the grammatical structure.

.. note:: |TRY| Try this yourself using ``http://translationparty.com/``

Machine translation is difficult because a given word could have several possible
translations (depending on its meaning), and because word order must be changed
in keeping with the grammatical structure of the target language.
Today these difficulties are being faced by collecting massive quantities of
parallel texts from news and government websites that publish documents
in two or more languages.  Given a document in German and English, and possibly
a bilingual dictionary, we can automatically pair up the sentences,
a process called `text alignment`:dt:.  Once we have a million or more sentence
pairs, we can detect corresponding words and phrases, and build a model
that can be used for translating new text.

Spoken Dialog Systems
---------------------

In the history of artificial intelligence, the chief measure of intelligence
has been a linguistic one, namely the `Turing Test`:dt:\ : can a dialogue system,
responding to a user's text input, perform so naturally that we cannot distinguish
it from a human-generated response?  In contrast, today's commercial dialogue systems
are very limited, but still perform useful functions in narrowly-defined domains,
as we see here:

| S: How may I help you?
| U: When is Saving Private Ryan playing?
| S: For what theater?
| U: The Paramount theater.
| S: Saving Private Ryan is not playing at the Paramount theater, but
| it's playing at the Madison theater at 3:00, 5:30, 8:00, and 10:30. 

You could not ask this system to provide driving instructions or
details of nearby restaurants unless the required information
had already been stored and suitable question-answer pairs
had been incorporated into the language processing system.

Observe that this system seems to understand the user's goals:
the user asks when a movie is showing and the system
correctly determines from this that the user wants to see
the movie. This inference seems so obvious that you probably
didn't notice it was made, yet a natural language system
needs to be endowed with this capability in order to interact
naturally.  Without it, when asked `Do you know when Saving Private
Ryan is playing?`:lx:, a system might unhelpfully respond with a cold `Yes`:lx:.
However, the developers of commercial dialogue systems use
contextual assumptions and business logic to ensure that the different ways in which a user might
express requests or provide information are handled in a way that
makes sense for the particular application.  So, if you type
`When is ...`:lx:, or `I want to know when ...`:lx:, or `Can you tell me
when ...`:lx:, simple rules will always yield screening times.  This is
enough for the system to provide a useful service.

.. _fig-sds:
.. figure:: ../images/dialogue.png
   :scale: 25:32:30

   Simple Pipeline Architecture for a Spoken Dialogue System:
   Spoken input (top left) is analyzed, words are recognized, sentences are parsed and
   interpreted in context, application-specific actions take place (top right);
   a response is planned, realized as a syntactic structure, then to suitably
   inflected words, and finally to spoken output; different types of
   linguistic knowledge inform each stage of the process.

Dialogue systems give us an opportunity to mention the
commonly assumed pipeline for |NLP|.
fig-sds_ shows the architecture of a simple dialogue system.
Along the top of the diagram, moving from left to right, is a
"pipeline" of some language understanding `components`:dt:.
These map from speech input via syntactic parsing
to some kind of meaning representation.  Along the middle, moving from
right to left, is the reverse pipeline of components for converting
concepts to speech.  These components make up the dynamic aspects of the system.
At the bottom of the diagram are some representative bodies of
static information: the repositories of language-related data that
the processing components draw on to do their work.

.. note:: |TRY|
   For an example of a primitive dialogue system, try having
   a conversation with an NLTK chatbot.  To see the available chatbots,
   run ``nltk.chat.chatbots()``.
   (Remember to ``import nltk`` first.) 

Textual Entailment
------------------

The challenge of language understanding has been brought into focus in recent years by a public
"shared task" called Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE). The basic
scenario is simple.  Suppose you want to find evidence to support
the hypothesis: `Sandra Goudie was defeated by Max Purnell`:lx:, and
that you have another short text that seems to be relevant, for example,
`Sandra Goudie was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 elections,
narrowly winning the seat of Coromandel by defeating Labour candidate
Max Purnell and pushing incumbent Green MP Jeanette Fitzsimons into
third place`:lx:.  Does the text provide enough evidence for you to
accept the hypothesis?  In this particular case, the answer will be "No."
You can draw this conclusion easily, but it is very hard to come up with 
automated methods for making the right decision. The RTE
Challenges provide data that allow competitors to develop their
systems, but not enough data for "brute force" machine learning techniques (a topic
we will cover in chap-data-intensive_\ ).  Consequently, some
linguistic analysis is crucial. In the previous example, it is important
for the system to note that `Sandra Goudie`:lx: names the person being
defeated in the hypothesis, not the person doing the defeating in the
text. As another illustration of the difficulty of the task, consider
the following text-hypothesis pair:

.. ex::
   .. ex:: Text: David Golinkin is the editor or author of eighteen books, and over 150 responsa, articles, sermons and books 
   .. ex:: Hypothesis: Golinkin has written eighteen books

In order to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the
text, the system needs the following background knowledge:
(i) if someone is an author of a book, then he/she has written that
book; (ii) if someone is an editor of a book, then he/she has not
written (all of) that book; (iii) if someone is editor or author of eighteen
books, then one cannot conclude that he/she is author of eighteen books. 

Limitations of |NLP|
--------------------

Despite the research-led advances in tasks like RTE, natural language
systems that have been deployed for real-world applications still cannot perform
common-sense reasoning or draw on world knowledge in a general and
robust manner.  We can wait for these difficult artificial
intelligence problems to be solved, but in the meantime it is
necessary to live with some severe limitations on the reasoning and
knowledge capabilities of natural language systems. Accordingly, right
from the beginning, an important goal of |NLP| research has been to
make progress on the difficult task of building technologies that
"understand language," using superficial yet powerful techniques instead of
unrestricted knowledge and reasoning capabilities.
Indeed, this is one of the goals of this book, and we hope to equip you with
the knowledge and skills to build useful |NLP| systems, and to
contribute to the long-term aspiration of building intelligent machines.
