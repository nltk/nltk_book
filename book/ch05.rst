5. Categorizing and Tagging Words
=================================

Back in elementary school you learnt the difference between nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs.  These "word classes" are not just
the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many
language processing tasks.  As we will see, they arise from simple analysis
of the distribution of words in text.  The goal of this chapter is to
answer the following questions:

#. What are lexical categories and how are they used in natural language processing?
#. What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories?
#. How can we automatically tag each word of a text with its word class?

Along the way, we'll cover some fundamental techniques in NLP, including
sequence labeling, n-gram models, backoff, and evaluation.  These techniques
are useful in many areas, and tagging gives us a simple context in which
to present them.  We will also see how tagging is the second step in the typical
|NLP| pipeline, following tokenization.

The process of classifying words into their `parts of speech`:dt: and
labeling them accordingly is known as `part-of-speech tagging`:dt:,
`POS-tagging`:dt:, or simply `tagging`:dt:.  Parts of speech
are also known as `word classes`:dt: or `lexical categories`:dt:.
The collection of tags
used for a particular task is known as a `tagset`:dt:.  Our emphasis
in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically.

.. _sec-using-a-tagger:

--------------
Using a Tagger
--------------

A part-of-speech tagger, or `POS-tagger`:dt:, processes a sequence of words, and attaches a
part of speech tag to each word (don't forget to ``import nltk``):

    >>> text = word_tokenize("And now for something completely different")
    >>> nltk.pos_tag(text)
    [('And', 'CC'), ('now', 'RB'), ('for', 'IN'), ('something', 'NN'),
    ('completely', 'RB'), ('different', 'JJ')]

Here we see that `and`:lx: is ``CC``, a coordinating conjunction;
`now`:lx: and `completely`:lx: are ``RB``, or adverbs;
`for`:lx: is ``IN``, a preposition;
`something`:lx: is ``NN``, a noun; and
`different`:lx: is ``JJ``, an adjective.

.. note::
   |NLTK| provides documentation for each tag, which can be queried using
   the tag, e.g. ``nltk.help.upenn_tagset('RB')``, or a regular
   expression, e.g. ``nltk.help.upenn_tagset('NN.*')``.
   Some corpora have README files with tagset documentation,
   see ``nltk.corpus.???.readme()``, substituting in the name
   of the corpus.

Let's look at another example, this time including some homonyms:

    >>> text = word_tokenize("They refuse to permit us to obtain the refuse permit")
    >>> nltk.pos_tag(text)
    [('They', 'PRP'), ('refuse', 'VBP'), ('to', 'TO'), ('permit', 'VB'), ('us', 'PRP'),
    ('to', 'TO'), ('obtain', 'VB'), ('the', 'DT'), ('refuse', 'NN'), ('permit', 'NN')]

Notice that `refuse`:lx: and `permit`:lx: both appear as a
present tense verb (``VBP``) and a noun (``NN``).
E.g. `refUSE`:lx: is a verb meaning "deny," while `REFuse`:lx: is
a noun meaning "trash" (i.e. they are not homophones).
Thus, we need to know which word is being used in order to pronounce
the text correctly.  (For this reason,
text-to-speech systems usually perform POS-tagging.)

.. note:: |TRY|
   Many words, like `ski`:lx: and `race`:lx:, can be used as nouns
   or verbs with no difference in pronunciation.  Can you think of
   others?  Hint: think of a commonplace object and try to put
   the word `to`:lx: before it to see if it can also be a verb, or
   think of an action and try to put `the`:lx: before it to see if
   it can also be a noun.  Now make up a sentence with both uses
   of this word, and run the POS-tagger on this sentence.  

Lexical categories like "noun" and part-of-speech tags like ``NN`` seem to have
their uses, but the details will be obscure to many readers.  You might wonder what
justification there is for introducing this extra level of information.
Many of these categories arise from superficial analysis the distribution
of words in text.  Consider the following analysis involving
`woman`:lx: (a noun), `bought`:lx: (a verb),
`over`:lx: (a preposition), and `the`:lx: (a determiner).
The ``text.similar()`` method takes a word `w`:math:, finds all contexts
`w`:math:\ `1`:subscript:\ `w`:math: `w`:math:\ `2`:subscript:,
then finds all words `w'`:math: that appear in the same context,
i.e. `w`:math:\ `1`:subscript:\ `w'`:math:\ `w`:math:\ `2`:subscript:.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> text = nltk.Text(word.lower() for word in nltk.corpus.brown.words())
    >>> text.similar('woman')
    Building word-context index...
    man day time year car moment world family house boy child country job
    state girl place war way case question
    >>> text.similar('bought')
    made done put said found had seen given left heard been brought got
    set was called felt in that told
    >>> text.similar('over')
    in on to of and for with from at by that into as up out down through
    about all is
    >>> text.similar('the')
    a his this their its her an that our any all one these my in your no
    some other and

Observe that searching for `woman`:lx: finds nouns;
searching for `bought`:lx: mostly finds verbs;
searching for `over`:lx: generally finds prepositions;
searching for `the`:lx: finds several determiners.
A tagger can correctly identify the tags on these words
in the context of a sentence, e.g. `The woman bought over $150,000
worth of clothes`:lx:.

A tagger can also model our knowledge of unknown words,
e.g. we can guess that `scrobbling`:lx: is probably a verb,
with the root `scrobble`:lx:,
and likely to occur in contexts like `he was scrobbling`:lx:. 

.. _sec-tagged-corpora:

--------------
Tagged Corpora

Representing Tagged Tokens
--------------------------

By convention in NLTK, a tagged token is represented using a 
tuple consisting of the token and the tag.
We can create one of these special tuples from the standard string
representation of a tagged token, using the function ``str2tuple()``:

    >>> tagged_token = nltk.tag.str2tuple('fly/NN')
    >>> tagged_token
    ('fly', 'NN')
    >>> tagged_token[0]
    'fly'
    >>> tagged_token[1]
    'NN'

We can construct a list of tagged tokens directly from a string.  The first
step is to tokenize the string
to access the individual ``word/tag`` strings, and then to convert
each of these into a tuple (using ``str2tuple()``).

    >>> sent = '''
    ... The/AT grand/JJ jury/NN commented/VBD on/IN a/AT number/NN of/IN
    ... other/AP topics/NNS ,/, AMONG/IN them/PPO the/AT Atlanta/NP and/CC
    ... Fulton/NP-tl County/NN-tl purchasing/VBG departments/NNS which/WDT it/PPS
    ... said/VBD ``/`` ARE/BER well/QL operated/VBN and/CC follow/VB generally/RB
    ... accepted/VBN practices/NNS which/WDT inure/VB to/IN the/AT best/JJT
    ... interest/NN of/IN both/ABX governments/NNS ''/'' ./.
    ... '''
    >>> [nltk.tag.str2tuple(t) for t in sent.split()]
    [('The', 'AT'), ('grand', 'JJ'), ('jury', 'NN'), ('commented', 'VBD'),
    ('on', 'IN'), ('a', 'AT'), ('number', 'NN'), ... ('.', '.')]

Reading Tagged Corpora
----------------------

Several of the corpora included with NLTK have been `tagged`:dt: for
their part-of-speech. Here's an example of what you might see if you
opened a file from the Brown Corpus with a text editor:

    The/at Fulton/np-tl County/nn-tl Grand/jj-tl Jury/nn-tl
    said/vbd Friday/nr an/at investigation/nn of/in Atlanta's/np$
    recent/jj primary/nn election/nn produced/vbd ``/`` no/at
    evidence/nn ''/'' that/cs any/dti irregularities/nns took/vbd
    place/nn ./.

Other corpora use a variety of formats for storing part-of-speech tags.
|NLTK|\ 's corpus readers provide a uniform interface so that you
don't have to be concerned with the different file formats.
In contrast with the file fragment shown above,
the corpus reader for the Brown Corpus represents the data as shown below.
Note that part-of-speech tags have been converted to uppercase, since this has
become standard practice since the Brown Corpus was published.

    >>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words()
    [('The', 'AT'), ('Fulton', 'NP-TL'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(tagset='universal')
    [('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NOUN'), ...]

Whenever a corpus contains tagged text, the |NLTK| corpus interface
will have a ``tagged_words()`` method.
Here are some more examples, again using the output format
illustrated for the Brown Corpus:

    >>> print(nltk.corpus.nps_chat.tagged_words())
    [('now', 'RB'), ('im', 'PRP'), ('left', 'VBD'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.conll2000.tagged_words()
    [('Confidence', 'NN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words()
    [('Pierre', 'NNP'), ('Vinken', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ...]

Not all corpora employ the same set of tags; see the
tagset help functionality and the ``readme()`` methods
mentioned above for documentation.
Initially we want to avoid the complications of these tagsets,
so we use a built-in mapping to the "Universal Tagset":

    >>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(tagset='universal')
    [('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NOUN'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words(tagset='universal')
    [('Pierre', 'NOUN'), ('Vinken', 'NOUN'), (',', '.'), ...]
    
Tagged corpora for several other languages are distributed with NLTK,
including Chinese, Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Catalan.
These usually contain non-ASCII text,
and Python always displays this in hexadecimal when printing a larger structure
such as a list.

    >>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.tagged_words()
    [('ä', 'Neu'), ('åæ', 'Nad'), ('åç', 'Nba'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.indian.tagged_words()
    [('মহিষের', 'NN'), ('সন্তান', 'NN'), (':', 'SYM'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.mac_morpho.tagged_words()
    [('Jersei', 'N'), ('atinge', 'V'), ('m\xe9dia', 'N'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.conll2002.tagged_words()
    [('Sao', 'NC'), ('Paulo', 'VMI'), ('(', 'Fpa'), ...]
    >>> nltk.corpus.cess_cat.tagged_words()
    [('El', 'da0ms0'), ('Tribunal_Suprem', 'np0000o'), ...]

If your environment is set up correctly, with appropriate editors and fonts,
you should be able to display individual strings in a human-readable way.
For example, fig-tag-indian_ shows data accessed using
``nltk.corpus.indian``.

.. _fig-tag-indian:
.. figure:: ../images/tag-indian.png
   :scale: 60

   POS-Tagged Data from Four Indian Languages: Bangla, Hindi, Marathi, and Telugu

..    इराक_NNP के_PREP विदेश_NNC मंत्री_NN ने_PREP अमरीका_NNP के_PREP उस_PRP प्रस्ताव_NN का_PREP मजाक_NVB उड़ाया_VFM है_VAUX ...

If the corpus is also segmented into sentences, it will have
a ``tagged_sents()`` method that divides up the tagged words into
sentences rather than presenting them as one big list.
This will be useful when we come to developing automatic taggers,
as they are trained and tested on lists of sentences, not words.

A Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset
---------------------------------

Tagged corpora use many different conventions for tagging words.
To help us get started, we will be looking at a simplified tagset
(shown in tab-universal-tagset_).

.. table:: tab-universal-tagset

   ========  ===================  ============================================
   Tag       Meaning              English Examples
   ========  ===================  ============================================
   ``ADJ``   adjective            `new, good, high, special, big, local`:lx:
   ``ADP``   adposition           `on, of, at, with, by, into, under`:lx:
   ``ADV``   adverb               `really, already, still, early, now`:lx:
   ``CONJ``  conjunction          `and, or, but, if, while, although`:lx:
   ``DET``   determiner, article  `the, a, some, most, every, no, which`:lx:
   ``NOUN``  noun                 `year, home, costs, time, Africa`:lx:
   ``NUM``   numeral              `twenty-four, fourth, 1991, 14:24`:lx: 
   ``PRT``   particle             `at, on, out, over per, that, up, with`:lx:
   ``PRON``  pronoun              `he, their, her, its, my, I, us`:lx:
   ``VERB``  verb                 `is, say, told, given, playing, would`:lx:
   ``.``     punctuation marks    `. , ; !`:lx:
   ``X``     other                `ersatz, esprit, dunno, gr8, univeristy`:lx:
   ========  ===================  ============================================

   Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset

Let's see which of these tags are the most common in the news
category of the Brown corpus:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> brown_news_tagged = brown.tagged_words(categories='news', tagset='universal')
    >>> tag_fd = nltk.FreqDist(tag for (word, tag) in brown_news_tagged)
    >>> tag_fd.most_common()
    [('NOUN', 30640), ('VERB', 14399), ('ADP', 12355), ('.', 11928), ('DET', 11389),
     ('ADJ', 6706), ('ADV', 3349), ('CONJ', 2717), ('PRON', 2535), ('PRT', 2264),
     ('NUM', 2166), ('X', 106)]

.. note:: |TRY|
   Plot the above frequency distribution using ``tag_fd.plot(cumulative=True)``.
   What percentage of words are tagged using the first five tags of the above list? 

We can use these tags to do powerful searches using a graphical
POS-concordance tool ``nltk.app.concordance()``.  Use it
to search for any combination of words and POS tags, e.g.
``N N N N``, ``hit/VD``, ``hit/VN``, or ``the ADJ man``.

Nouns
-----

Nouns generally refer to people, places, things, or concepts, e.g.:
`woman, Scotland, book, intelligence`:lx:.  Nouns can appear after
determiners and adjectives, and can be the subject or object of the
verb, as shown in tab-syntax-nouns_.

.. table:: tab-syntax-nouns

   ============    =============================================  ==================================================
   Word            After a determiner                             Subject of the verb
   ============    =============================================  ==================================================
   woman           *the* woman who I saw yesterday ...            the woman *sat* down
   Scotland        *the* Scotland I remember as a child ...       Scotland *has* five million people
   book            *the* book I bought yesterday ...              this book *recounts* the colonization of Australia
   intelligence    *the* intelligence displayed by the child ...  Mary's intelligence *impressed* her teachers
   ============    =============================================  ==================================================

   Syntactic Patterns involving some Nouns

The simplified noun tags are ``N`` for common nouns like `book`:lx:,
and ``NP`` for proper nouns like `Scotland`:lx:.

Let's inspect some tagged text to see what parts of speech occur before a noun,
with the most frequent ones first. To begin with, we construct a list
of bigrams whose members are themselves word-tag pairs such as
``(('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NP'))`` and  ``(('Fulton', 'NP'), ('County', 'N'))``.
Then we construct a ``FreqDist`` from the tag parts of the bigrams.

    >>> word_tag_pairs = nltk.bigrams(brown_news_tagged)
    >>> noun_preceders = [a[1] for (a, b) in word_tag_pairs if b[1] == 'NOUN']
    >>> fdist = nltk.FreqDist(noun_preceders)
    >>> [tag for (tag, _) in fdist.most_common()]
    ['NOUN', 'DET', 'ADJ', 'ADP', '.', 'VERB', 'CONJ', 'NUM', 'ADV', 'PRT', 'PRON', 'X']

This confirms our assertion that nouns occur after determiners and
adjectives, including numeral adjectives (tagged as ``NUM``). 

.. TO-DO say something about some of the other contexts?


Verbs
-----

Verbs are words that describe events and actions, e.g. `fall`:lx:,
`eat`:lx: in tab-syntax-verbs_.
In the context of a sentence, verbs typically express a relation
involving the referents of one or more noun phrases.

.. table:: tab-syntax-verbs

   =====  ===============  ===============================================
   Word   Simple           With modifiers and adjuncts (italicized)
   =====  ===============  ===============================================
   fall   Rome fell        Dot com stocks *suddenly* fell *like a stone*
   eat    Mice eat cheese  John ate the pizza *with gusto*
   =====  ===============  ===============================================

   Syntactic Patterns involving some Verbs


What are the most common verbs in news text?  Let's sort all the verbs by frequency:

    >>> wsj = nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words(tagset='universal')
    >>> word_tag_fd = nltk.FreqDist(wsj)
    >>> [wt[0] for (wt, _) in word_tag_fd.most_common() if wt[1] == 'VERB']
    ['is', 'said', 'are', 'was', 'be', 'has', 'have', 'will', 'says', 'would',
     'were', 'had', 'been', 'could', "'s", 'can', 'do', 'say', 'make', 'may',
     'did', 'rose', 'made', 'does', 'expected', 'buy', 'take', 'get', 'might',
     'sell', 'added', 'sold', 'help', 'including', 'should', 'reported', ...]

Note that the items being counted in the frequency distribution are word-tag pairs.
Since words and tags are paired, we can treat the word as a condition and the tag
as an event, and initialize a conditional frequency distribution with a list of
condition-event pairs.  This lets us see a frequency-ordered list of tags given a word:

    >>> cfd1 = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(wsj)
    >>> cfd1['yield'].most_common()
    [('VERB', 28), ('NOUN', 20)]
    >>> cfd1['cut'].most_common()
    [('VERB', 25), ('NOUN', 3)]

We can reverse the order of the pairs, so that the tags are the conditions, and the
words are the events.  Now we can see likely words for a given tag. We
will do this for the WSJ tagset rather than the universal tagset:

    >>> wsj = nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words()
    >>> cfd2 = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist((tag, word) for (word, tag) in wsj)
    >>> list(cfd2['VBN'])
    ['been', 'expected', 'made', 'compared', 'based', 'priced', 'used', 'sold',
    'named', 'designed', 'held', 'fined', 'taken', 'paid', 'traded', 'said', ...]

To clarify the distinction between ``VBD`` (past tense) and ``VBN``
(past participle), let's find words which can be both ``VBD`` and
``VBN``, and see some surrounding text:

    >>> [w for w in cfd1.conditions() if 'VBD' in cfd1[w] and 'VBN' in cfd1[w]]
    ['Asked', 'accelerated', 'accepted', 'accused', 'acquired', 'added', 'adopted', ...]
    >>> idx1 = wsj.index(('kicked', 'VBD'))
    >>> wsj[idx1-4:idx1+1]
    [('While', 'IN'), ('program', 'NN'), ('trades', 'NNS'), ('swiftly', 'RB'),
     ('kicked', 'VBD')]
    >>> idx2 = wsj.index(('kicked', 'VBN'))
    >>> wsj[idx2-4:idx2+1]
    [('head', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('state', 'NN'), ('has', 'VBZ'), ('kicked', 'VBN')]

In this case, we see that the past participle of `kicked`:lx: is preceded by a form of
the auxiliary verb `have`:lx:. Is this generally true?

.. note:: |TRY|
   Given the list of past participles produced by
   ``list(cfd2['VN'])``, try to collect a list of all the word-tag
   pairs that immediately precede items in that list. 

Adjectives and Adverbs
----------------------

Two other important word classes are `adjectives`:dt: and `adverbs`:dt:.
Adjectives describe nouns, and can be used as modifiers
(e.g. `large`:lx: in `the large pizza`:lx:), or in predicates (e.g. `the
pizza is large`:lx:).  English adjectives can have internal structure
(e.g.  `fall+ing`:lx: in `the falling
stocks`:lx:).  Adverbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place or
direction of the event described by the verb (e.g. `quickly`:lx: in
`the stocks fell quickly`:lx:).  Adverbs may also modify adjectives
(e.g. `really`:lx: in `Mary's teacher was really nice`:lx:).

English has several categories of closed class words in addition to
prepositions, such as `articles`:dt: (also often called `determiners`:dt:)
(e.g., `the`:lx:, `a`:lx:), `modals`:dt: (e.g., `should`:lx:,
`may`:lx:), and `personal pronouns`:dt: (e.g., `she`:lx:, `they`:lx:).
Each dictionary and grammar classifies these words differently.

.. note:: |TRY|
   If you are uncertain about some of these parts of speech, study them using
   ``nltk.app.concordance()``, or watch some of the *Schoolhouse Rock!*
   grammar videos available at YouTube, or consult the Further Reading
   section at the end of this chapter.

Unsimplified Tags
-----------------

Let's find the most frequent nouns of each noun part-of-speech type.
The program in code-findtags_ finds all tags starting with ``NN``,
and provides a few example words for each one.  You will see that
there are many variants of ``NN``; the most important contain ``$``
for possessive nouns, ``S`` for plural nouns (since plural nouns
typically end in `s`:lx:) and ``P`` for proper nouns.  In addition,
most of the tags have suffix modifiers: ``-NC`` for citations, ``-HL``
for words in headlines and ``-TL`` for titles (a feature of Brown tabs).

.. pylisting:: code-findtags
   :caption: Program to Find the Most Frequent Noun Tags

    def findtags(tag_prefix, tagged_text):
        cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist((tag, word) for (word, tag) in tagged_text
                                      if tag.startswith(tag_prefix))
        return dict((tag, cfd[tag].most_common(5)) for tag in cfd.conditions())

    >>> tagdict = findtags('NN', nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(categories='news'))
    >>> for tag in sorted(tagdict):
    ...     print(tag, tagdict[tag])
    ...
    NN [('year', 137), ('time', 97), ('state', 88), ('week', 85), ('man', 72)]
    NN$ [("year's", 13), ("world's", 8), ("state's", 7), ("nation's", 6), ("company's", 6)]
    NN$-HL [("Golf's", 1), ("Navy's", 1)]
    NN$-TL [("President's", 11), ("Army's", 3), ("Gallery's", 3), ("University's", 3), ("League's", 3)]
    NN-HL [('sp.', 2), ('problem', 2), ('Question', 2), ('business', 2), ('Salary', 2)]
    NN-NC [('eva', 1), ('aya', 1), ('ova', 1)]
    NN-TL [('President', 88), ('House', 68), ('State', 59), ('University', 42), ('City', 41)]
    NN-TL-HL [('Fort', 2), ('Dr.', 1), ('Oak', 1), ('Street', 1), ('Basin', 1)]
    NNS [('years', 101), ('members', 69), ('people', 52), ('sales', 51), ('men', 46)]
    NNS$ [("children's", 7), ("women's", 5), ("janitors'", 3), ("men's", 3), ("taxpayers'", 2)]
    NNS$-HL [("Dealers'", 1), ("Idols'", 1)]
    NNS$-TL [("Women's", 4), ("States'", 3), ("Giants'", 2), ("Bros.'", 1), ("Writers'", 1)]
    NNS-HL [('comments', 1), ('Offenses', 1), ('Sacrifices', 1), ('funds', 1), ('Results', 1)]
    NNS-TL [('States', 38), ('Nations', 11), ('Masters', 10), ('Rules', 9), ('Communists', 9)]
    NNS-TL-HL [('Nations', 1)]

When we come to constructing part-of-speech taggers later in this chapter,
we will use the unsimplified tags.

Exploring Tagged Corpora
------------------------

Let's briefly return to the kinds of exploration of corpora we saw in previous chapters,
this time exploiting POS tags.

Suppose we're studying the word `often`:lx: and want to see how it is used
in text.  We could ask to see the words that follow `often`:lx:

    >>> brown_learned_text = brown.words(categories='learned')
    >>> sorted(set(b for (a, b) in nltk.bigrams(brown_learned_text) if a == 'often'))
    [',', '.', 'accomplished', 'analytically', 'appear', 'apt', 'associated', 'assuming',
    'became', 'become', 'been', 'began', 'call', 'called', 'carefully', 'chose', ...]

However, it's probably more instructive use the ``tagged_words()``
method to look at the part-of-speech tag of the following words:

    >>> brown_lrnd_tagged = brown.tagged_words(categories='learned', tagset='universal')
    >>> tags = [b[1] for (a, b) in nltk.bigrams(brown_lrnd_tagged) if a[0] == 'often']
    >>> fd = nltk.FreqDist(tags)
    >>> fd.tabulate()
     PRT  ADV  ADP    . VERB  ADJ 
       2    8    7    4   37    6 

Notice that the most high-frequency parts of speech following `often`:lx: are verbs.
Nouns never appear in this position (in this particular corpus).

Next, let's look at some larger context, and find words involving
particular sequences of tags and words (in this case ``"<Verb> to <Verb>"``).
In code-three-word-phrase we consider each three-word window in the sentence three-word_,
and check if they meet our criterion verb-to-verb_.  If the tags
match, we print the corresponding words print-words_.

.. pylisting:: code-three-word-phrase
   :caption: Searching for Three-Word Phrases Using POS Tags

    from nltk.corpus import brown
    def process(sentence):
        for (w1,t1), (w2,t2), (w3,t3) in nltk.trigrams(sentence): # [_three-word]
            if (t1.startswith('V') and t2 == 'TO' and t3.startswith('V')): # [_verb-to-verb]

Finally, let's look for words that are highly ambiguous as to their part of speech tag.
Understanding why such words are tagged as they are in each context can help us clarify
the distinctions between the tags.

    >>> data = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist((word.lower(), tag)
    ...                                 for (word, tag) in brown_news_tagged)

   of the word correlates with the context of the word.
   E.g. search for ``near`` to see all forms mixed together, ``near/ADJ`` to see it used
   as an adjective, ``near N`` to see just those cases where a noun follows, and so forth.
   For a larger set of examples, modify the supplied code so that it lists words having
   three distinct tags.



.. _sec-automatic-tagging:

-----------------
Automatic Tagging
-----------------

In the rest of this chapter we will explore various ways to automatically
add part-of-speech tags to text.  We will see that the tag of a word depends
on the word and its context within a sentence.  For this reason, we will
be working with data at the level of (tagged) sentences rather than words.
We'll begin by loading the data we will be using.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> brown_tagged_sents = brown.tagged_sents(categories='news')
    >>> brown_sents = brown.sents(categories='news')

The Default Tagger
------------------

The simplest possible tagger assigns the same tag to each token.  This
may seem to be a rather banal step, but it establishes an important
baseline for tagger performance.  In order to get the best result, we
tag each word with the most likely tag.  Let's find out which tag is
most likely (now using the unsimplified tagset):

    >>> tags = [tag for (word, tag) in brown.tagged_words(categories='news')]
    >>> nltk.FreqDist(tags).max()
    'NN'

Now we can create a tagger that tags everything as ``NN``.

    >>> raw = 'I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am!'
    >>> tokens = word_tokenize(raw)
    >>> default_tagger = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')
    >>> default_tagger.tag(tokens)
    [('I', 'NN'), ('do', 'NN'), ('not', 'NN'), ('like', 'NN'), ('green', 'NN'),
    ('eggs', 'NN'), ('and', 'NN'), ('ham', 'NN'), (',', 'NN'), ('I', 'NN'),
    ('do', 'NN'), ('not', 'NN'), ('like', 'NN'), ('them', 'NN'), ('Sam', 'NN'),
    ('I', 'NN'), ('am', 'NN'), ('!', 'NN')]

Unsurprisingly, this method performs rather poorly.
On a typical corpus, it will tag only about an eighth of the tokens correctly,
as we see below:

    >>> default_tagger.evaluate(brown_tagged_sents)
    0.13089484257215028

Default taggers assign their tag to every single word, even words that
have never been encountered before.  As it happens, once we have processed
several thousand words of English text, most new words will be nouns.
As we will see, this means that default taggers can help to improve the
robustness of a language processing system.  We will return to them
shortly.

The Regular Expression Tagger
-----------------------------

The regular expression tagger assigns tags to tokens on the basis of
matching patterns.  For instance, we might guess that any word ending
in `ed`:lx: is the past participle of a verb, and any word ending with
`'s`:lx: is a possessive noun.  We can express these as a list of
regular expressions:

    >>> patterns = [
    ...     (r'.*ing$', 'VBG'),               # gerunds
    ...     (r'.*ed$', 'VBD'),                # simple past
    ...     (r'.*es$', 'VBZ'),                # 3rd singular present
    ...     (r'.*ould$', 'MD'),               # modals
    ...     (r'.*\'s$', 'NN$'),               # possessive nouns
    ...     (r'.*s$', 'NNS'),                 # plural nouns
    ...     (r'^-?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?$', 'CD'),  # cardinal numbers
    ...     (r'.*', 'NN')                     # nouns (default)
    ... ]

Note that these are processed in order, and the first one that matches is applied.
Now we can set up a tagger and use it to tag a sentence.  Now its right about a fifth
of the time.

    >>> regexp_tagger = nltk.RegexpTagger(patterns)
    >>> regexp_tagger.tag(brown_sents[3])
    [('``', 'NN'), ('Only', 'NN'), ('a', 'NN'), ('relative', 'NN'), ('handful', 'NN'),
    ('of', 'NN'), ('such', 'NN'), ('reports', 'NNS'), ('was', 'NNS'), ('received', 'VBD'),
    ("''", 'NN'), (',', 'NN'), ('the', 'NN'), ('jury', 'NN'), ('said', 'NN'), (',', 'NN'),
    ('``', 'NN'), ('considering', 'VBG'), ('the', 'NN'), ('widespread', 'NN'), ...]
    >>> regexp_tagger.evaluate(brown_tagged_sents)
    0.20326391789486245

The final regular expression |l|\ ``.*``\ |r| is a catch-all that tags everything as a noun.
This is equivalent to the default tagger (only much less efficient).
Instead of re-specifying this as part of the regular expression tagger,
is there a way to combine this tagger with the default tagger?  We
will see how to do this shortly.

.. note:: |TRY|
   See if you can come up with patterns to improve the performance of the above
   regular expression tagger.  (Note that sec-supervised-classification_
   describes a way partially automate such work.)

The Lookup Tagger
-----------------

A lot of high-frequency words do not have the ``NN`` tag.
Let's find the hundred most frequent words and store their most likely tag.
We can then use this information as the model for a "lookup tagger"
(an |NLTK| ``UnigramTagger``):

    >>> fd = nltk.FreqDist(brown.words(categories='news'))
    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(brown.tagged_words(categories='news'))
    >>> most_freq_words = fd.most_common(100)
    >>> likely_tags = dict((word, cfd[word].max()) for (word, _) in most_freq_words)
    >>> baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model=likely_tags)
    >>> baseline_tagger.evaluate(brown_tagged_sents)
    0.45578495136941344

It should come as no surprise by now that simply
knowing the tags for the 100 most frequent words enables us to tag a large fraction of
tokens correctly (nearly half in fact). 
Let's see what it does on some untagged input text:

    >>> sent = brown.sents(categories='news')[3]
    >>> baseline_tagger.tag(sent)
    [('``', '``'), ('Only', None), ('a', 'AT'), ('relative', None),
    ('handful', None), ('of', 'IN'), ('such', None), ('reports', None), 
    ('was', 'BEDZ'), ('received', None), ("''", "''"), (',', ','),
    ('the', 'AT'), ('jury', None), ('said', 'VBD'), (',', ','), 
    ('``', '``'), ('considering', None), ('the', 'AT'), ('widespread', None), 
    ('interest', None), ('in', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('election', None), 
    (',', ','), ('the', 'AT'), ('number', None), ('of', 'IN'),
    ('voters', None), ('and', 'CC'), ('the', 'AT'), ('size', None),
    ('of', 'IN'), ('this', 'DT'), ('city', None), ("''", "''"), ('.', '.')]

Many words have been assigned a tag of ``None``,
because they were not among the 100 most frequent words.
In these cases we would like to assign the default tag of ``NN``.
In other words, we want to use the lookup table first,
and if it is unable to assign a tag, then use the default tagger,
a process known as `backoff`:dt: (sec-n-gram-tagging_).
We do this by specifying one tagger as a parameter to the other,
as shown below.  Now the lookup tagger will only store word-tag pairs
for words other than nouns, and whenever it cannot assign a tag to a
word it will invoke the default tagger.  

    >>> baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model=likely_tags,
    ...                                      backoff=nltk.DefaultTagger('NN'))

Let's put all this together and write a program to create and
evaluate lookup taggers having a range of sizes, in code-baseline-tagger_.

.. pylisting:: code-baseline-tagger
   :caption: Lookup Tagger Performance with Varying Model Size

   def performance(cfd, wordlist):
       lt = dict((word, cfd[word].max()) for word in wordlist)
       baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model=lt, backoff=nltk.DefaultTagger('NN'))
       return baseline_tagger.evaluate(brown.tagged_sents(categories='news'))

   def display():
       import pylab
       word_freqs = nltk.FreqDist(brown.words(categories='news')).most_common()
       words_by_freq = [w for (w, _) in word_freqs]
       cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(brown.tagged_words(categories='news'))
       sizes = 2 ** pylab.arange(15)
       perfs = [performance(cfd, words_by_freq[:size]) for size in sizes]
       pylab.plot(sizes, perfs, '-bo')
       pylab.title('Lookup Tagger Performance with Varying Model Size')
       pylab.xlabel('Model Size')
       pylab.ylabel('Performance')
       pylab.show()

   >>> display()                                  # doctest: +SKIP

   :scale: 20:20:30

   Lookup Tagger

Observe that performance initially increases rapidly as the model size grows, eventually
reaching a plateau, when large increases in model size yield little improvement
in performance.  (This example used the ``pylab`` plotting package, discussed
in app-libraries_.)

Evaluation
----------

In the above examples, you will have noticed an emphasis on
accuracy scores.  In fact, evaluating the performance of
such tools is a central theme in |NLP|.  Recall the processing
pipeline in fig-sds_\ ; any errors in the output of one
module are greatly multiplied in the downstream modules.

We evaluate the performance of a tagger relative to the tags
a human expert would assign.  Since we don't usually have access
to an expert and impartial human judge, we make do instead with
`gold standard`:dt: test data. This is a corpus which has been manually
annotated and which is accepted as a standard against which the
guesses of an automatic system are assessed. The tagger is regarded as
being correct if the tag it guesses for a given word is the same as
the gold standard tag.

Of course, the humans who designed and carried out the
original gold standard annotation were only human. Further
analysis might show mistakes in the gold standard, or may
eventually lead to a revised tagset and more elaborate guidelines.
Nevertheless, the gold standard is by definition "correct"
as far as the evaluation of an automatic tagger is concerned.

.. note::
   Developing an annotated corpus is a major undertaking.
   Apart from the data, it generates sophisticated tools,
   documentation, and practices for ensuring high quality
   annotation.  The tagsets and other coding schemes inevitably
   depend on some theoretical position that is not shared by
   all, however corpus creators often go to great lengths to
   make their work as theory-neutral as possible in order to
   maximize the usefulness of their work.  We will discuss
   the challenges of creating a corpus in chap-data_.

.. _sec-n-gram-tagging:

--------------
N-Gram Tagging
--------------

Unigram Tagging
---------------

Unigram taggers are based on a simple statistical algorithm:
for each token, assign the tag that is most likely for
that particular token. For example, it will assign the tag ``JJ`` to any
occurrence of the word `frequent`:lx:, since `frequent`:lx: is used as an
adjective (e.g. `a frequent word`:lx:) more often than it is used as a
verb (e.g. `I frequent this cafe`:lx:).
A unigram tagger behaves just like a lookup tagger (sec-automatic-tagging_),
except there is a more convenient technique for setting it up,
called `training`:dt:\ .  In the following code sample,
we train a unigram tagger, use it to tag a sentence, then evaluate:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import brown
    >>> brown_tagged_sents = brown.tagged_sents(categories='news')
    >>> brown_sents = brown.sents(categories='news')
    >>> unigram_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(brown_tagged_sents)
    >>> unigram_tagger.tag(brown_sents[2007])
    [('Various', 'JJ'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('apartments', 'NNS'),
    ('are', 'BER'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('terrace', 'NN'), ('type', 'NN'),
    (',', ','), ('being', 'BEG'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('ground', 'NN'),
    ('floor', 'NN'), ('so', 'QL'), ('that', 'CS'), ('entrance', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'),
    ('direct', 'JJ'), ('.', '.')]
    >>> unigram_tagger.evaluate(brown_tagged_sents)
    0.9349006503968017

We `train`:dt: a ``UnigramTagger`` by specifying tagged sentence data as
a parameter when we initialize the tagger.  The training process involves
inspecting the tag of each word and storing the most likely tag for any word
in a dictionary, stored inside the tagger.

Separating the Training and Testing Data
----------------------------------------

Now that we are training a tagger on some data, we must be careful not to test it on the
same data, as we did in the above example.  A tagger that simply memorized its training data
and made no attempt to construct a general model would get a perfect score, but would also
be useless for tagging new text.  Instead, we should split the data, training on 90% and
testing on the remaining 10%:

    >>> size = int(len(brown_tagged_sents) * 0.9)
    >>> size
    4160
    >>> train_sents = brown_tagged_sents[:size]
    >>> test_sents = brown_tagged_sents[size:]
    >>> unigram_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(train_sents)
    >>> unigram_tagger.evaluate(test_sents)
    0.811721...

Although the score is worse, we now have a better picture of the usefulness of
this tagger, i.e. its performance on previously unseen text. 

General N-Gram Tagging
----------------------

When we perform a language processing task based on unigrams, we are using
one item of context.  In the case of tagging, we only consider the current
token, in isolation from any larger context.  Given such a model, the best
we can do is tag each word with its *a priori* most likely tag.
This means we would tag a word such as `wind`:lx: with the same tag,
regardless of whether it appears in the context `the wind`:lx: or
`to wind`:lx:\ .

An `n-gram tagger`:dt: is a generalization of a unigram tagger whose context is
the current word together with the part-of-speech tags of the
*n*\ -1 preceding tokens, as shown in fig-tag-context_. The tag to be
chosen, *t*\ `n`:subscript:, is circled, and the context is shaded
in grey. In the example of an n-gram tagger shown in fig-tag-context_,
we have *n*\ =3; that is, we consider the tags of the two preceding words in addition
to the current word.  An n-gram tagger
picks the tag that is most likely in the given context. 

.. _fig-tag-context:
.. figure:: ../images/tag-context.png
   :scale: 80

   Tagger Context

.. note::
   A 1-gram tagger is another term for a unigram tagger: i.e.,
   the context used to tag a token is just the text of the token itself.
   2-gram taggers are also called *bigram taggers*, and 3-gram taggers
   are called *trigram taggers*.

The ``NgramTagger`` class uses a tagged training corpus to determine which
part-of-speech tag is most likely for each context.  Here we see
a special case of an n-gram tagger, namely a bigram tagger.
First we train it, then use it to tag untagged sentences:

    >>> bigram_tagger = nltk.BigramTagger(train_sents)
    >>> bigram_tagger.tag(brown_sents[2007])
    [('Various', 'JJ'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('apartments', 'NNS'),
    ('are', 'BER'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('terrace', 'NN'),
    ('type', 'NN'), (',', ','), ('being', 'BEG'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'),
    ('ground', 'NN'), ('floor', 'NN'), ('so', 'CS'), ('that', 'CS'),
    ('entrance', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'), ('direct', 'JJ'), ('.', '.')]
    >>> unseen_sent = brown_sents[4203]
    >>> bigram_tagger.tag(unseen_sent)
    [('The', 'AT'), ('population', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('Congo', 'NP'),
    ('is', 'BEZ'), ('13.5', None), ('million', None), (',', None), ('divided', None),
    ('into', None), ('at', None), ('least', None), ('seven', None), ('major', None),
    ('``', None), ('culture', None), ('clusters', None), ("''", None), ('and', None),
    ('innumerable', None), ('tribes', None), ('speaking', None), ('400', None),
    ('separate', None), ('dialects', None), ('.', None)]

Notice that the bigram tagger manages to tag every word in a sentence it saw during
training, but does badly on an unseen sentence.  As soon as it encounters a new word
(i.e., `13.5`:lx:), it is unable to assign a tag.  It cannot tag the following word
(i.e., `million`:lx:) even if it was seen during training, simply because it never
saw it during training with a ``None`` tag on the previous word.  Consequently, the
tagger fails to tag the rest of the sentence.  Its overall accuracy score is very low: 

    >>> bigram_tagger.evaluate(test_sents)
    0.102063...

.. expand the following discussion if possible:

As *n* gets larger, the specificity of the contexts increases,
as does the chance that the data we wish to tag contains contexts that
were not present in the training data. This is known as the *sparse
data* problem, and is quite pervasive in NLP. As a consequence, there is a
trade-off between the accuracy and the coverage of our results (and
this is related to the `precision/recall trade-off`:dt: in information
retrieval).

.. caution:: n-gram taggers should not consider context that crosses a
   sentence boundary.  Accordingly, NLTK taggers are designed to work
   with lists of sentences, where each sentence is a list of words.  At
   the start of a sentence, *t*\ `n-1`:subscript: and preceding
   tags are set to ``None``.

Combining Taggers
-----------------

One way to address the trade-off between accuracy and coverage is to
use the more accurate algorithms when we can, but to fall back on
algorithms with wider coverage when necessary. For example, we could
combine the results of a bigram tagger, a unigram tagger, and
a default tagger, as follows:

1. Try tagging the token with the bigram tagger.
2. If the bigram tagger is unable to find a tag for the token, try
   the unigram tagger.
3. If the unigram tagger is also unable to find a tag, use a default tagger.

Most |NLTK| taggers permit a backoff-tagger to be specified.
The backoff-tagger may itself have a backoff tagger:

    >>> t0 = nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')
    >>> t1 = nltk.UnigramTagger(train_sents, backoff=t0)
    >>> t2 = nltk.BigramTagger(train_sents, backoff=t1)
    >>> t2.evaluate(test_sents)
    0.844513...

.. Note:: |TRY|
   Extend the above example by defining a ``TrigramTagger`` called
   ``t3``, which backs off to ``t2``.

Note that we specify the backoff tagger when the tagger is
initialized so that training can take advantage of the backoff tagger.
Thus, if the bigram tagger would assign the same tag
as its unigram backoff tagger in a certain context,
the bigram tagger discards the training instance.
This keeps the bigram tagger model as small as possible.  We can
further specify that a tagger needs to see more than one instance of a
context in order to retain it, e.g. ``nltk.BigramTagger(sents, cutoff=2, backoff=t1)``
will discard contexts that have only been seen once or twice.

Tagging Unknown Words
---------------------

Our approach to tagging unknown words still uses backoff to a regular-expression tagger
or a default tagger.  These are unable to make use of context.  Thus, if our tagger
encountered the word `blog`:lx:, not seen during training, it would assign it the same tag,
regardless of whether this word appeared in the context `the blog`:lx: or `to blog`:lx:.
How can we do better with these unknown words, or `out-of-vocabulary`:dt: items?

A useful method to tag unknown words based on context is to limit the vocabulary
of a tagger to the most frequent `n`:math: words, and to replace every other word
with a special word `UNK`:lx: using the method shown in sec-dictionaries_.
During training, a unigram tagger will probably learn that `UNK`:lx: is usually a noun.
However, the n-gram taggers will detect contexts in which it has some other tag.
For example, if the preceding word is `to`:lx: (tagged ``TO``), then `UNK`:lx:
will probably be tagged as a verb.

.. XXX TODO: classification of unknown words based on string patterns

Storing Taggers
---------------

Training a tagger on a large corpus may take a significant time.  Instead of training a tagger
every time we need one, it is convenient to save a trained tagger in a file for later re-use.
Let's save our tagger ``t2`` to a file ``t2.pkl``.

    >>> from pickle import dump
    >>> output = open('t2.pkl', 'wb')
    >>> dump(t2, output, -1)
    >>> output.close()

Now, in a separate Python process, we can load our saved tagger.

    >>> from pickle import load
    >>> input = open('t2.pkl', 'rb')
    >>> tagger = load(input)
    >>> input.close()

Now let's check that it can be used for tagging.

    >>> text = """The board's action shows what free enterprise
    ...     is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws ."""
    >>> tokens = text.split()
    >>> tagger.tag(tokens)
    [('The', 'AT'), ("board's", 'NN$'), ('action', 'NN'), ('shows', 'NNS'),
    ('what', 'WDT'), ('free', 'JJ'), ('enterprise', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'),
    ('up', 'RP'), ('against', 'IN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('our', 'PP$'), ('complex', 'JJ'),
    ('maze', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('regulatory', 'NN'), ('laws', 'NNS'), ('.', '.')]

Performance Limitations
-----------------------

What is the upper limit to the performance of an n-gram tagger?
Consider the case of a trigram tagger.  How many cases of part-of-speech ambiguity does it
encounter?  We can determine the answer to this question empirically:

    >>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
    ...            ((x[1], y[1], z[0]), z[1])
    ...            for sent in brown_tagged_sents
    ...            for x, y, z in nltk.trigrams(sent))
    >>> ambiguous_contexts = [c for c in cfd.conditions() if len(cfd[c]) > 1]
    >>> sum(cfd[c].N() for c in ambiguous_contexts) / cfd.N()
    0.049297702068029296

Thus, one out of twenty trigrams is ambiguous [EXAMPLES].  Given the
current word and the previous two tags, in 5% of cases there is more than one tag
that could be legitimately assigned to the current word according to
the training data.  Assuming we always pick the most likely tag in
such ambiguous contexts, we can derive a lower bound on
the performance of a trigram tagger.

.. be more specific about this bound?

Another way to investigate the performance of a tagger is to study
its mistakes.  Some tags may be harder than others to assign, and
it might be possible to treat them specially by pre- or post-processing
the data.  A convenient way to look at tagging errors is the
`confusion matrix`:dt:.  It charts expected tags (the gold standard)
against actual tags generated by a tagger:

    >>> test_tags = [tag for sent in brown.sents(categories='editorial')
    ...                  for (word, tag) in t2.tag(sent)]
    >>> gold_tags = [tag for (word, tag) in brown.tagged_words(categories='editorial')]
    >>> print(nltk.ConfusionMatrix(gold_tags, test_tags))           # doctest: +SKIP

.. XXX EXAMPLE OF CONFUSION MATRIX

Based on such analysis we may decide to modify the tagset.  Perhaps
a distinction between tags that is difficult to make can be dropped,
since it is not important in the context of some larger processing task.

Another way to analyze the performance bound on a tagger comes from
the less than 100% agreement between human annotators.  [MORE]

In general, observe that the tagging process collapses distinctions:
e.g. lexical identity is usually lost when all personal pronouns are
tagged ``PRP``.  At the same time, the tagging process introduces
new distinctions and removes ambiguities: e.g. `deal`:lx: tagged as ``VB`` or ``NN``.
This characteristic of collapsing certain distinctions and introducing new
distinctions is an important feature of tagging which
facilitates classification and prediction.
When we introduce finer distinctions in a tagset, an n-gram tagger gets
more detailed information about the left-context when it is deciding
what tag to assign to a particular word.
However, the tagger simultaneously has to do more work to classify the
current token, simply because there are more tags to choose from.
Conversely, with fewer distinctions (as with the simplified tagset),
the tagger has less information about context, and it has a smaller
range of choices in classifying the current token.

We have seen that ambiguity in the training data leads to an upper limit
in tagger performance.  Sometimes more context will resolve the
ambiguity.  In other cases however, as noted by [Abney1996PST]_, the
ambiguity can only be resolved with reference to syntax, or to world
knowledge.  Despite these imperfections, part-of-speech tagging has
played a central role in the rise of statistical approaches to natural
language processing.  In the early 1990s, the surprising accuracy of
statistical taggers was a striking demonstration that it was possible
to solve one small part of the language understanding problem, namely
part-of-speech disambiguation, without reference to deeper sources of
linguistic knowledge.  Can this idea be pushed further?  In chap-chunk_,
we shall see that it can.

.. _sec-transformation-based-tagging:

----------------------------
Transformation-Based Tagging
----------------------------

A potential issue with n-gram taggers is the size of their n-gram
table (or language model).  If tagging is to be employed in a variety
of language technologies deployed on mobile computing devices, it is
important to strike a balance between model size and tagger
performance.  An n-gram tagger with backoff may store trigram and
bigram tables, large sparse arrays which may have hundreds of millions
of entries.

A second issue concerns context.  The only information an n-gram
tagger considers from prior context is tags, even though words
themselves might be a useful source of information.  It is simply
impractical for n-gram models to be conditioned on the identities of
words in the context.  In this section we examine Brill tagging,
an inductive tagging method which performs very well using models
that are only a tiny fraction of the size of n-gram taggers.

`Brill Tagging`:dt: is a kind of *transformation-based learning*, named
after its inventor.  The
general idea is very simple: guess the tag of each word, then go back
and fix the mistakes.  In this way, a Brill tagger successively
transforms a bad tagging of a text into a better one.  As with n-gram
tagging, this is a *supervised learning* method, since we need
annotated training data to figure out whether the tagger's guess is a
mistake or not.  However, unlike n-gram tagging, it does
not count observations but compiles a list of transformational
correction rules.

The process of Brill tagging is usually explained by analogy with
painting.  Suppose we were painting a tree, with all its details of
boughs, branches, twigs and leaves, against a uniform sky-blue
background.  Instead of painting the tree first then trying to paint
blue in the gaps, it is simpler to paint the whole canvas blue, then
"correct" the tree section by over-painting the blue background.  In
the same fashion we might paint the trunk a uniform brown before going
back to over-paint further details with even finer brushes.  Brill
tagging uses the same idea: begin with broad brush strokes then fix up
the details, with successively finer changes.  Let's look at an
example involving the following sentence:

.. ex::
   The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states
   for vocational rehabilitation

We will examine the operation of two rules:
(a) Replace ``NN`` with ``VB`` when the previous word is ``TO``;
(b) Replace ``TO`` with ``IN`` when the next tag is ``NNS``. 
tab-brill-tagging_
illustrates this process, first tagging with the unigram tagger, then
applying the rules to fix the errors.

.. table:: tab-brill-tagging

   ===========  ==  ========  ======  ====  ======  ===  ==========  ==============
   **Phrase**   to  increase  grants  to    states  for  vocational  rehabilitation

   ===========  ==  ========  ======  ====  ======  ===  ==========  ==============

   Steps in Brill Tagging
 
In this table we see two rules.  All such rules are generated from a
template of the following form: "replace *T*\ :subscript:`1` with
*T*\ :subscript:`2` in the context *C*".  Typical contexts are the
identity or the tag of the preceding or following word, or the
appearance of a specific tag within 2-3 words of the current word.  During
its training phase, the tagger guesses values for *T*\ :subscript:`1`,
*T*\ :subscript:`2` and *C*, to create thousands of candidate rules.
Each rule is scored according to its net benefit: the
number of incorrect tags that it corrects, less the number of correct
tags it incorrectly modifies.

.. XXX How Brill tagger rules are learnt

Brill taggers have another interesting property: the rules are
linguistically interpretable.  Compare this with the n-gram taggers,
which employ a potentially massive table of n-grams.  We cannot learn
much from direct inspection of such a table, in comparison to the
rules learned by the Brill tagger.

---------------------------------------
How to Determine the Category of a Word
---------------------------------------

Now that we have examined word classes in detail, we turn to a more
basic question: how do we decide what category a word belongs to in
the first place? In general, linguists use morphological, syntactic,
and semantic clues to determine the category of a word.

Morphological Clues
-------------------

The internal structure of a word may give useful clues as to the
word's category. For example, `-ness`:lx: is a suffix
that combines with an adjective to produce a noun, e.g.
`happy`:lx: |rarr| `happiness`:lx:, `ill`:lx: |rarr| `illness`:lx:. So
if we encounter a word that ends in `-ness`:lx:, this is very likely
to be a noun.  Similarly, `-ment`:lx: is a suffix that combines
with some verbs to produce a noun, e.g.
`govern`:lx: |rarr| `government`:lx: and `establish`:lx: |rarr| `establishment`:lx:.

English verbs can also be morphologically complex.  For instance, the
`present participle`:dt: of a verb ends in `-ing`:lx:, and expresses
the idea of ongoing, incomplete action (e.g. `falling`:lx:, `eating`:lx:).
The `-ing`:lx: suffix also appears on nouns derived from verbs, e.g. `the
falling of the leaves`:lx: (this is known as the `gerund`:dt:).

Syntactic Clues
---------------

Another source of information is the typical contexts in which a word can
occur. For example, assume that we have already determined the
category of nouns. Then we might say that a syntactic criterion for an
adjective in English is that it can occur immediately before a noun,
or immediately following the words `be`:lx: or `very`:lx:. According
to these tests, `near`:lx: should be categorized as an adjective:

.. ex::
   .. ex:: the near window
   .. ex:: The end is (very) near.

Semantic Clues
--------------

Finally, the meaning of a word is a useful clue as to its lexical
category.  For example, the best-known definition of a noun is
semantic: "the name of a person, place or thing". Within modern linguistics,
semantic criteria for word classes are treated with suspicion, mainly
because they are hard to formalize. Nevertheless, semantic criteria
underpin many of our intuitions about word classes, and enable us to
make a good guess about the categorization of words in languages that
we are unfamiliar with.  For example, if all we know about the Dutch word
`verjaardag`:lx: is that it means the same as the English word
`birthday`:lx:, then we can guess that `verjaardag`:lx: is a noun in
Dutch. However, some care is needed: although we might translate `zij
is vandaag jarig`:lx: as `it's her birthday today`:lx:, the word
`jarig`:lx: is in fact an adjective in Dutch, and has no exact
equivalent in English.

New Words
---------

All languages acquire new lexical items. A list of words recently
added to the Oxford Dictionary of English includes `cyberslacker,
fatoush, blamestorm, SARS, cantopop, bupkis, noughties, muggle`:lx:, and
`robata`:lx:. Notice that all these new words are nouns, and this is
reflected in calling nouns an `open class`:dt:. By contrast, prepositions
are regarded as a `closed class`:dt:. That is, there is a limited set of
words belonging to the class (e.g., `above, along, at, below, beside,
between, during, for, from, in, near, on, outside, over, past,
through, towards, under, up, with`:lx:), and membership of the set only
changes very gradually over time.

Morphology in Part of Speech Tagsets
------------------------------------

.. TODO: Modal verbs, e.g. `would`:lx: ...

Common tagsets often capture some `morpho-syntactic`:dt: information;
that is, information about the kind of morphological markings that
words receive by virtue of their syntactic role.  Consider, for
example, the selection of distinct grammatical forms of the word
`go`:lx: illustrated in the following sentences:

.. _ex-go:
.. ex::
  .. ex:: *Go* away!
  .. ex::  He sometimes *goes* to the cafe.
  .. ex::  All the cakes have *gone*.
  .. ex::  We *went* on the excursion.

Each of these forms |mdash| `go`:lx:, `goes`:lx:, `gone`:lx:, and `went`:lx: |mdash|
is morphologically distinct from the others. Consider the form,
`goes`:lx:. This occurs in a restricted set of grammatical contexts, and
requires a third person singular subject. Thus, the
following sentences are ungrammatical.

.. ex::
  .. ex:: \*They sometimes *goes* to the cafe.
  .. ex:: \*I sometimes *goes* to the cafe.

By contrast, `gone`:lx: is the past participle form; it is required
after `have`:lx: (and cannot be replaced in this context by
`goes`:lx:), and cannot occur as the main verb of a clause. 

.. ex::
  .. ex:: \*All the cakes have *goes*.
  .. ex:: \*He sometimes *gone* to the cafe.

We can easily imagine a tagset in which the four distinct
grammatical forms just discussed were all tagged as ``VB``. Although
this would be adequate for some purposes, a more fine-grained tagset
provides useful information about these forms that can help
other processors that try to detect patterns in tag
sequences.  The Brown tagset captures these distinctions,
as summarized in tab-morphosyntax_.

.. table:: tab-morphosyntax

   =======  ======================  =====
   Form     Category                Tag
   =======  ======================  =====
   go       base                    VB
   goes     3rd singular present    VBZ
   gone     past participle         VBN
   going    gerund                  VBG
   went     simple past             VBD
   =======  ======================  =====

   Some morphosyntactic distinctions in the Brown tagset

In addition to this set of verb tags, the various forms of the verb `to be`:lx:
have special tags:
``be/BE, being/BEG, am/BEM, are/BER, is/BEZ, been/BEN, were/BED`` and
``was/BEDZ`` (plus extra tags for negative forms of the verb).   All told,
this fine-grained tagging of verbs means that an automatic tagger
that uses this tagset is effectively carrying out a limited amount
of `morphological analysis`:dt:.

Most part-of-speech tagsets make use of the same basic categories,
such as noun, verb, adjective, and preposition. However, tagsets
differ both in how finely they divide words into categories, and in
how they define their categories. For example, `is`:lx: might be tagged
simply as a verb in one tagset; but as a distinct form of the lexeme `be`:lx:
in another tagset (as in the Brown Corpus).  This variation in tagsets is
unavoidable, since part-of-speech tags are used in different ways for
different tasks. In other words, there is no one 'right way' to assign
tags, only more or less useful ways depending on one's goals.

.. TODO: tagging other languages

----------
Scaling Up
----------

In many situations, we want to POS tag a large quantity of text for
some downstream task. For this reason, |NLTK| provides an easy-to-use
interface to the `Stanford Tagger`:dt:. To use it, you will need a
machine with a recent version of Java, and you will need to download
the tagger and its trained models from ``http://nlp.stanford.edu/software``.
The tagger comes with several models for English using the Penn
Treebank tagset, supporting various amounts of
context, some case-sensitive others case-insensitive.
There are also models for Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish.

In order for |NLTK| to find the Stanford Tagger and its models, you
will need to set two environment variables:
``CLASSPATH`` should include the pathname of the folder that contains
the ``stanford-postagger.jar`` file;
``STANFORD_MODELS`` should include the pathname of the folder
that contains the model files,
e.g. ``english-bidirectional-distsim.tagger``.
With this set-up, you can run the tagger as follows:

    >>> from nltk.tag import StanfordPOSTagger
    >>> tagger = StanfordPOSTagger('english-bidirectional-distsim.tagger')
    >>> tagger.tag('What is the airspeed of an unladen swallow ?'.split())
    [('What', 'WP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('the', 'DT'), ('airspeed', 'NN'),
    ('of', 'IN'), ('an', 'DT'), ('unladen', 'JJ'), ('swallow', 'VB'), ('?', '.')]

The tagger supports the standard NLTK tagger interface, and so we can
tag sets of sentences, and we can perform evaluation:

    >>> from nltk.corpus import treebank
    >>> tagger.tag_sents(treebank.sents())
    [[('Pierre', 'NNP'), ('Vinken', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ('61', 'CD'),
    ('years', 'NNS'), ('old', 'JJ'), (',', ','), ('will', 'MD'), ...], ...]
    >>> tagger.evaluate(treebank.tagged_sents())
    0.913008065477373

.. note::
   |NLTK| invokes the Stanford Tagger as a separate process. Each time
   the tagger is used there is an overhead for interprocess
   communication. Thus, if you need to tag multiple sentences, it is
   faster to use ``tag_sents()`` once instead of calling ``tag()`` multiple times.

-------
Summary
-------

* Words can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
  These classes are known as lexical categories or parts of speech.
  Parts of speech are assigned short labels, or tags, such as ``NN``, ``VB``,

* The process of automatically assigning parts of speech to words in text
  is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.

* Automatic tagging is an important step in the |NLP| pipeline,
  and is useful in a variety of situations including:
  predicting the behavior of previously unseen words,
  analyzing word usage in corpora, and text-to-speech systems.

* Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.

* A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g.
  default tagger, regular expression tagger, unigram tagger and n-gram taggers.
  These can be combined using a technique known as backoff.

* Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.

* Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more specialized
  model (such as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a given
  context, we backoff to a more general model (such as a unigram tagger). 

* Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence
  classification task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point
  in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the local context.

* A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information,
  such as a string and a number: ``freq['cat'] = 12``.  We create
  dictionaries using the brace notation: ``pos = {}``,
  ``pos = {'furiously': 'adv', 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}``.

* N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of *n*, but once
  *n* is larger than 3 we usually encounter the sparse data problem;
  even with a large quantity of training data we only see a tiny
  fraction of possible contexts.

* Transformation-based tagging involves learning a series
  of repair rules of the form "change tag `s`:math: to tag
  `t`:math: in context `c`:math:\ ", where each rule
  fixes mistakes and possibly introduces a (smaller) number 
  of errors.

Tagging HOWTO at |NLTK-HOWTO-URL|.
Chapters 4 and 5 of [JurafskyMartin2008]_ contain more advanced
material on n-grams and part-of-speech tagging.
The "Universal Tagset" is described by [Petrov2011]_.
Other approaches to tagging involve machine learning methods (chap-data-intensive_).
In chap-chunk_ we will see a generalization of tagging called *chunking* in which a
contiguous sequence of words is assigned a single tag.

For tagset documentation, see
``nltk.help.upenn_tagset()`` and ``nltk.help.brown_tagset()``.
Lexical categories are introduced in linguistics textbooks, including those
listed in chap-introduction_.

There are many other kinds of tagging.
Words can be tagged with directives to a speech synthesizer,
indicating which words should be emphasized.  Words can be tagged with sense
numbers, indicating which sense of the word was used.  Words can also
be tagged with morphological features.
Examples of each of these kinds of tags are shown below.
For space reasons, we only show the tag for a single
word. Note also that the first two examples use XML-style
tags, where elements in angle brackets enclose the word that is
tagged.

1. *Speech Synthesis Markup Language (W3C SSML):*
   ``That is a <emphasis>big</emphasis> car!``
#. *SemCor: Brown Corpus tagged with WordNet senses:*
   ``Space in any <wf pos="NN" lemma="form" wnsn="4">form</wf>
   is completely measured by the three dimensions.``
   (Wordnet form/nn sense 4: "shape, form, configuration,
   contour, conformation")
#. *Morphological tagging, from the Turin University Italian Treebank:*
   ``E' italiano , come progetto e realizzazione , il
   primo (PRIMO ADJ ORDIN M SING) porto turistico dell' Albania .``

Note that tagging is also performed at higher levels.  Here is an example
of dialogue act tagging, from the NPS Chat Corpus [Forsyth2007]_ included with
|NLTK|.  Each turn of the dialogue is categorized as to its communicative
function::

    Statement  User117 Dude..., I wanted some of that

   Train a unigram tagger and run it on some new text.
   Observe that some words are not assigned a tag.  Why not?

#. |easy|
   Learn about the affix tagger (type ``help(nltk.AffixTagger)``).
   Train an affix tagger and run it on some new text.
   Experiment with different settings for the affix length
   and the minimum word length.  Discuss your findings.

#. |easy|
   Train a bigram tagger with no backoff tagger, and run it on some of the training
   data.  Next, run it on some new data.
   What happens to the performance of the tagger?  Why?

#. |easy| We can use a dictionary to specify the values to be
   substituted into a formatting string.  Read Python's library
   documentation for formatting strings
   ``http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html``
   and use this method to display today's date in two
   different formats.

#. |soso| Use ``sorted()`` and ``set()`` to get a sorted list of tags used in the Brown
   corpus, removing duplicates.

#. |soso| Write programs to process the Brown Corpus and find answers to the following
   questions:

   #) Which nouns are more common in their plural form, rather than their singular
      form? (Only consider regular plurals, formed with the `-s`:lx: suffix.)
   #) Which word has the greatest number of distinct tags.  What are they, and
      what do they represent?
   #) List tags in order of decreasing frequency.  What do the 20 most frequent tags represent?
   #) Which tags are nouns most commonly found after?  What do these tags represent?

#. |soso| Explore the following issues that arise in connection with the lookup tagger:

   a) What happens to the tagger performance for the various
      model sizes when a backoff tagger is omitted?
   b) Consider the curve in fig-tag-lookup_; suggest a
      good size for a lookup tagger that balances memory and performance.
      Can you come up with scenarios where it would be preferable to
      minimize memory usage, or to maximize performance with no regard for memory usage?

#. |soso| What is the upper limit of performance for a lookup tagger,
   assuming no limit to the size of its table?  (Hint: write a program
   to work out what percentage of tokens of a word are assigned
   the most likely tag for that word, on average.)

#. |soso| Generate some statistics for tagged data to answer the following questions:

   a)  What proportion of word types are always assigned the same part-of-speech tag?
   #)  How many words are ambiguous, in the sense that they appear with at least two tags?
   #)  What percentage of word *tokens* in the Brown Corpus involve
       these ambiguous words?

#. |soso| The ``evaluate()`` method works out how accurately
   the tagger performs on this text.  For example, if the supplied tagged text
   was ``[('the', 'DT'), ('dog', 'NN')]`` and the tagger produced the output
   ``[('the', 'NN'), ('dog', 'NN')]``, then the score would be ``0.5``.
   Let's try to figure out how the evaluation method works:

   a) A tagger ``t`` takes a list of words as input, and produces a list of tagged words
      as output.  However, ``t.evaluate()`` is given correctly tagged text as its only parameter.
      What must it do with this input before performing the tagging?
   b) Once the tagger has created newly tagged text, how might the ``evaluate()`` method
      go about comparing it with the original tagged text and computing the accuracy score?
   c) Now examine the source code to see how the method is implemented.  Inspect
      ``nltk.tag.api.__file__`` to discover the location of the source code,
      and open this file using an editor (be sure to use the ``api.py`` file and
      not the compiled ``api.pyc`` binary file).

#. |soso| Write code to search the Brown Corpus for particular words and phrases
   according to tags, to answer the following questions:

   a)  Produce an alphabetically sorted list of the distinct words tagged as ``MD``.
   #)  Identify words that can be plural nouns or third person singular verbs
       (e.g. `deals`:lx:, `flies`:lx:).
   #)  Identify three-word prepositional phrases of the form IN + DET + NN
       (eg. `in the lab`:lx:).
   #)  What is the ratio of masculine to feminine pronouns?

#. |soso| In tab-absolutely_ we saw a table involving frequency counts for
   the verbs `adore`:lx:, `love`:lx:, `like`:lx:, `prefer`:lx: and
   preceding qualifiers `absolutely`:lx: and `definitely`:lx:.
   Investigate the full range of adverbs that appear before these four verbs.

#. |soso|
   We defined the ``regexp_tagger`` that can be used
   as a fall-back tagger for unknown words.  This tagger only checks for
   cardinal numbers.  By testing for particular prefix or suffix strings,
   it should be possible to guess other tags.  For example, 
   we could tag any word that ends with `-s`:lx: as a plural noun.
   Define a regular expression tagger (using ``RegexpTagger()``)
   that tests for at least five other patterns in the spelling of words.
   (Use inline documentation to explain the rules.)

#. |soso|
   Consider the regular expression tagger developed in the exercises in
   the previous section.  Evaluate the tagger using its ``accuracy()`` method,
   and try to come up with ways to improve its performance.  Discuss your findings.
   How does objective evaluation help in the development process?

#. |soso|
   How serious is the sparse data problem?  Investigate the
   performance of n-gram taggers as `n`:math: increases from 1 to 6.
   Tabulate the accuracy score.  Estimate the training data required
   for these taggers, assuming a vocabulary size of
   10\ `5`:superscript: and a tagset size of 10\ `2`:superscript:.

#. |soso| Obtain some tagged data for another language, and train and
   evaluate a variety of taggers on it.  If the language is
   morphologically complex, or if there are any orthographic clues
   (e.g. capitalization) to word classes, consider developing a
   regular expression tagger for it (ordered after the unigram
   tagger, and before the default tagger).  How does the accuracy of
   your tagger(s) compare with the same taggers run on English data?
   Discuss any issues you encounter in applying these methods to the language.

#. |soso| code-baseline-tagger_ plotted a curve showing
   change in the performance of a lookup tagger as the model size was increased.
   Plot the performance curve for a unigram tagger, as the amount of training
   data is varied.

#. |soso|
   Inspect the confusion matrix for the bigram tagger ``t2`` defined in sec-n-gram-tagging_,
   and identify one or more sets of tags to collapse.  Define a dictionary to do
   the mapping, and evaluate the tagger on the simplified data.

#. |soso|
   Experiment with taggers using the simplified tagset (or make one of your
   own by discarding all but the first character of each tag name).
   Such a tagger has fewer distinctions to make, but much less
   information on which to base its work.  Discuss your findings.

#. |soso|
   Recall the example of a bigram tagger which encountered a word it hadn't
   seen during training, and tagged the rest of the sentence as ``None``.
   It is possible for a bigram tagger to fail part way through a sentence
   even if it contains no unseen words (even if the sentence was used during
   training).  In what circumstance can this happen?  Can you write a program
   to find some examples of this?

#. |soso|
   Preprocess the Brown News data by replacing low frequency words with `UNK`:lx:,
   but leaving the tags untouched.  Now train and evaluate a bigram tagger
   on this data.  How much does this help?  What is the contribution of the unigram
   tagger and default tagger now?

#. |soso|
   Modify the program in code-baseline-tagger_ to use a logarithmic scale on
   the *x*\ -axis, by replacing ``pylab.plot()`` with ``pylab.semilogx()``.
   What do you notice about the shape of the resulting plot?  Does the gradient
   tell you anything?

#. |soso|
   Consult the documentation for the Brill tagger demo function,
   using ``help(nltk.tag.brill.demo)``.
   Experiment with the tagger by setting different values for the parameters.
   Is there any trade-off between training time (corpus size) and performance?

#. |soso| Write code that builds a dictionary of dictionaries of sets.
   Use it to store the set of POS tags that can follow a given word having
   a given POS tag, i.e. word\ `i`:subscript: |rarr| tag\ `i`:subscript:
   |rarr| tag\ `i+1`:subscript:.

#. |hard| There are 264 distinct words in the Brown Corpus having exactly
   three possible tags.

   a)  Print a table with the integers 1..10 in one column, and the
       number of distinct words in the corpus having 1..10 distinct tags
       in the other column.
   #)  For the word with the greatest number of distinct tags, print
       out sentences from the corpus containing the word, one for each
       possible tag.

#. |hard| Write a program to classify contexts involving the word `must`:lx: according
   to the tag of the following word.  Can this be used to discriminate between the
   epistemic and deontic uses of `must`:lx:?

#. |hard|
   Create a regular expression tagger and various unigram and n-gram taggers,
   incorporating backoff, and train them on part of the Brown corpus.

   a) Create three different combinations of the taggers. Test the
      accuracy of each combined tagger. Which combination works best?
   #) Try varying the size of the training corpus. How does it affect
      your results?

#. |hard|
   Our approach for tagging an unknown word has been to consider the letters of the word
   (using ``RegexpTagger()``), or to ignore the word altogether and tag
   it as a noun (using ``nltk.DefaultTagger()``).  These methods will not do well for texts having
   new words that are not nouns.
   Consider the sentence `I like to blog on Kim's blog`:lx:.  If `blog`:lx: is a new
   word, then looking at the previous tag (``TO`` versus ``NP$``) would probably be helpful.
   I.e. we need a default tagger that is sensitive to the preceding tag.

   a) Create a new kind of unigram tagger that looks at the tag of the previous word,
      and ignores the current word.  (The best way to do this is to modify the source
      code for ``UnigramTagger()``, which presumes knowledge of object-oriented
      programming in Python.)
   b) Add this tagger to the sequence of backoff taggers (including ordinary trigram
      and bigram taggers that look at words), right before the usual default tagger.
   c) Evaluate the contribution of this new unigram tagger.

#. |hard|
   Consider the code in sec-n-gram-tagging_ which
   determines the upper bound for accuracy of a trigram tagger.
   Review Abney's discussion concerning the impossibility of
   exact tagging [Abney1996PST]_.  Explain why correct tagging of
   these examples requires access to other kinds of information than
   just words and tags.  How might you estimate the scale of this problem?
   
#. |hard|
   Use some of the estimation techniques in ``nltk.probability``,
   such as *Lidstone* or *Laplace* estimation, to develop a statistical
   tagger that does a better job than n-gram backoff taggers in cases where
   contexts encountered during testing were not seen during training.

#. |hard|
   Inspect the diagnostic files created by the Brill tagger ``rules.out`` and
   ``errors.out``.  Obtain the demonstration code by accessing the source code
   (at ``http://www.nltk.org/code``)
   and create your own version of the Brill tagger.
   Delete some of the rule templates, based on what you learned from inspecting ``rules.out``.
   Add some new rule templates which employ contexts that might help to
   correct the errors you saw in ``errors.out``.

#. |hard|
   Develop an n-gram backoff tagger that permits "anti-n-grams" such as
   ``["the", "the"]`` to be specified when a tagger is initialized.
   An anti-ngram is assigned a count of zero and is used to prevent
   backoff for this n-gram (e.g. to avoid
   estimating P(\ `the`:lx: \| `the`:lx:\ ) as just P(\ `the`:lx:\ )).

#. |hard|
   Investigate three different ways to define the split between training and
   testing data when developing a tagger using the Brown Corpus:
   genre (``category``), source (``fileid``), and sentence.
   Compare their relative performance and discuss which method
   is the most legitimate.  (You might use n-fold cross validation,
   discussed in sec-evaluation_, to improve the accuracy of the evaluations.)  

#. |hard|
   Develop your own ``NgramTagger`` class that inherits from NLTK's class,
   and which encapsulates the method of collapsing the vocabulary of
   the tagged training and testing data that was described in
   this chapter.  Make sure that the unigram and default backoff taggers
   have access to the full vocabulary.
