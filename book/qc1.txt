General issues
==============

* Will further attention be given to end-of-line
  word breaks? Some of the current breaks, particularly for code examples, seem
  sub-optimal.

* At present, menu items are rendered inconsistently as italic, cw, and roman. We
  propose to adopt italic, since this seems to be O'Reilly housestyle.

* We've suggested changes that involve editing the content, even though we realize
  this is not desirable from the point of view of the copy editing process.

p89 fig 3-2 scale smaller?

p91 in 4th sent of sect 3.3, different fonts seem to be being used for the 4

seem to be in cw font. Can this be fixed? (Similarly, p 93 13up, p94 15d)

say it s/b cw.

     ex 29:  the mathematical expression should formatted as such, not cw

     ex 31: add the following at the start of this exercise
         (where material inside double backticks is set in cw)
      "Define the variable ``saying`` to contain the list
      ``['After', 'all', 'is', 'said', 'and', 'done', ',', 'more',
      'is', 'said', 'than', 'done', '.']``.
       Process this list using a ``for`` loop...

p128 Fig 4-1 caption: foo, bar s/b cw (x 2)

p131 20-22d replace semicolon with colon, and delete to the end of the paragraph (28 words)
 
     12up move the tag [1] earlier so it appears straight after "comma operator"

p133 Para starting "Notice in this code sample..." has been displaced.
     It should appear on the previous page, after the code output (29, 5, 2)
     and before the "Your Turn" note.

p135 13up lexicon s/b cw, assignment statement shouldn't be split inside variable name

     -> "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other languages."
     "However, Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives,

p222 ok to make into a paragraph

p223 "'names' corpus" -> "Names Corpus"

p225 13up "Movie Reviews corpus" -> "Movie Reviews Corpus"

p231 This is meant to be introducing the terms.  The remainder of 
    the paragraph is describing how these three models work in
    general terms.  I recommend the following rewording to make this
    clear:

       Another solution is to assign scores to all of the possible
       sequences of part-of-speech tags, and to choose the sequence
       whose overall score is highest. This is the approach taken by
       <emphasis role="strong">Hidden Markov Models</emphasis>.
       Hidden Markov Models are similar to consecutive classifiers in
       that they look at both the inputs and the history of predicted
       tags. However, rather than simply finding the single best tag
       for a given word, they generate a probability distribution over
       tags. These probabilities are then combined to calculate
       probability scores for tag sequences, and the tag sequence with
       the highest probability is chosen. Unfortunately, the number of
       possible tag sequences is quite large. Given a tag set with 30
       tags, there are about 600 trillion
       (30<superscript>10</superscript>) ways to label a 10-word
       sentence.  In order to avoid considering all these possible
       sequences separately, Hidden Markov Models require that the
       feature extractor only look at the most recent tag (or the most
       recent <emphasis>n</emphasis> tags, where
       <emphasis>n</emphasis> is fairly small). Given that
       restriction, it is possible to use dynamic programming (Section
       4.7) to efficiently find the most likely tag sequence. In
       particular, for each consecutive word index
       <emphasis>i</emphasis>, a score is computed for each possible
       current and previous tag.  This same basic approach is taken by
       two more advanced models, called <emphasis
       role="strong">Maximum Entropy Markov Models</emphasis> and
       <emphasis role="strong">Linear-Chain Conditional Random Field
       Models</emphasis>; but different algorithms are used to find
       scores for tag sequences.

p234 Change the paragraph "We let words..." to start:

       In our RTE feature detector (Example 6.7), we let words...

p241 Append the following sentence to the paragraph preceeding example
      6-9 (i.e., the paragraph starting "For example, Figure 6-5 shows.."):

      Example 6-9 demonstrates how to calculate the entropy
      of a list of labels.

p245 Change the sentence "This process is illustrated in
      Figure 6-7" to say "This process is illustrated in Figures
      6-7 and 6-8."

p246 ELE and Heldout Estimation should be boldface, and not quoted.
