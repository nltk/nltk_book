    <P> The NL Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python package intended to simplify
    the task of programming natural language processing systems.  Its
    primary audience is graduate and undergraduate students studying
    computational linguistics.</P>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>

    Several different types of documentation are available, describing
    different aspects of the toolkit.

    <UL>
      <LI> <a href="tutorial/index.html">Tutorials</a> teach students
      how to use the toolkit, in the context of performing specific
      tasks.  They are appropriate for anyone who wishes to learn how
      to use the toolkit. </LI>

      <LI> The toolkit's <a href="ref/">reference
      documentation</a> describes every module, interface, class,
      method, function, and variable in the toolkit.  This
      documentation should be useful to both users and
      developers. </LI>

      <LI> A number of <a href="tech/index.html">technical reports</a>
      are available.  These reports explain and justify the toolkit's
      design and implementation.  They are used by the developers of
      the toolkit to guide and document the toolkit's construction.
      Students can consult these reports if they would like further
      information about how the toolkit is designed and why it is
      designed that way. </LI>
    </UL>

<!-- ==========================
    <h3>Problem Sets</h3>

    <P> Sample <a href="psets/index.html">problem sets and
    solutions</a> are available to help you learn to use the toolkit,
    and to give you an idea of the types of things you can use the
    toolkit to do. </P>
     ========================== -->

    <h3>Download</h3>

    <P> Official releases of the toolkit are available from the 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30982">
      SourceForge download page</a>. The <a
      href="getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> guide gives
      detailed instructions for installing and using NLTK. </p>
    

    <h3>Open Source</h3>

    <p> NLTK is an open source project, currently released under the
    IBM Common Public License.  All source code and documentation may
    be freely distributed and modified, in accordance with the
    license.  NLTK is a member of OpenNLP, an umbrella project for
    open source NLP projects.  See the <a
    href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net">OpenNLP webpage</a> for more
    information, and to find other open source NLP projects. </p>

    <h3>Current Status</h3>

    <P> See the <a href="timetable.html">timetable</a> or the
    SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=30982">
    tasklist</a> for more information about the current status of the
    toolkit. </P>

    <h3>Contribute to NLTK</h3>

    <P> NLTK contains source code contributed by several people.  To
    facilitate more community involvement, we have set up a <a
    href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/nltk/nltk/src/nltk_contrib/">src/nltk_contrib/</a>
    directory for hosting third-party contributions to NLTK.  These
    could include: student projects based on NLTK, new versions of
    existing NLTK modules, and code for Python modules not yet
    integrated into NLTK.  If you have code to contribute, please email it to 
    <a href="mailto:edloper@gradient.cis.upenn.edu,sb@cs.mu.oz.au">Edward D. Loper and Steven Bird</a>.

    <h3>Courses using NLTK</h3>

    <P> NLTK was designed for use in CIS-530 at the University of Pennsylvania,
    beginning in 2000.  It has since been used in courses at several other institutions.</P>
