<h2>Installing the NLTK Corpora Package</h2>

This directory contains the standard corpus set for NLTK 1.1.  Each
corpus or corpus sample is contained in a single zip archive
(e.g. "brown.zip") that unzips to a subdirectory of the same name
(e.g. "brown/").  Each corpus is accompanied by a readme file (e.g.,
"brown.readme") that describes the corpus's contents, copyright, and
license.

<h3>Unix Installation</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Create a directory to hold the NLTK corpus set.  Common paths
       for this directory are /usr/lib/nltk; /usr/local/lib/nltk;
       and /usr/share/nltk.  If you are not a system administrator,
       you can put this directory in your home (e.g. ~/nltk_corpora).
    <pre>
           mkdir /usr/lib/nltk
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> Uncompress each corpus that you'd like to use to into the
       NLTK corpus directory that you created.
    <pre>
           unzip <i>corpus</i>.zip -d /usr/lib/nltk
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> If the NLTK corpus directory that you created is not in
       /usr/lib/nltk, /usr/local/lib/nltk, or /usr/share/nltk, then
       you will need to tell NLTK where to find the corpora.  You can
       do this by setting the NLTK_CORPORA environment variable:
    <pre>
           export NLTK_CORPORA=/usr/lib/nltk_corpora  # for sh or bash
           setenv NLTK_CORPORA /usr/lib/nltk_corpora  # for csh or tcsh
    </pre>
       Alternatively, you can also use the function set_basedir() in
       the module nltk.corpus:
    <pre>
           &gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.corpus import set_basedir
           &gt;&gt;&gt; set_basedir('/usr/lib/nltk_corpora')
    </pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Windows Installation</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Create a folder to hold the NLTK corpus set.  Common names
       for this folder are C:\Program Files\Python2.2\nltk; and
       C:\Program Files\Python2.2\lib\nltk.

  </li>
  <li> Uncompress each corpus that you'd like to use to into the
       NLTK corpus directory that you created.  Typically, this
       is done by copying <corpus>.zip into the NLTK corpus folder
       that you created; and double-clicking on <corpus>.zip.
       However, depending on what tool you use to unzip files,
       the procedure might be slightly different.  If you don't
       already have a tool to unzip files, you can use the WinZip
       <http://www.winzip.com> evaluation version.

  </li>
  <li> If the NLTK corpus folder that you created is not in
       <i>path-to-python</i>\nltk or <i>path-to-python</i>\lib\nltk,
       then you will need to tell NLTK where to find the corpora.  You
       can do this by setting the NLTK_CORPORA environment variable.
       For most versions of Windows, this enviroment variable can be
       set with the following procedure:

    <ol>
      <li> Right click on "My Computer".</li>
      <li> Select the "Advanced" tab.</li>
      <li> Click on "Environment Variables"</li>
      <li> Under "User Variables," click "New..."</li>
      <li> Type "NLTK_CORPORA" into the "Variable Name" field;
           and type the path to the NLTK corpus folder that you
           created into the "Variable Value" field.</li>
      <li> Hit "Ok" (3 times) to close the dialog windows.</li>
  
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Macintosh Installation (OS X)</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Create a directory to hold the NLTK corpus set.  A common path
       for this directory is /usr/share/nltk.  If you are not a system
       administrator, you can put this directory in your home
       (e.g. ~/nltk_corpora).
    <pre>
           mkdir /usr/share/nltk
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> Uncompress each corpus that you'd like to use to into the
       NLTK corpus directory that you created.
    <pre>
           unzip <i>corpus</i>.zip -d /usr/share/nltk
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> If the NLTK corpus directory that you created is not in
       /usr/lib/nltk, /usr/local/lib/nltk, or /usr/share/nltk, then
       you will need to tell NLTK where to find the corpora.  You can
       do this by setting the NLTK_CORPORA environment variable:
    <pre>
           export NLTK_CORPORA=/home/me/nltk  # for sh or bash
           setenv NLTK_CORPORA /home/me/nltk  # for csh or tcsh
    </pre>
       Alternatively, you can also use the function set_basedir() in
       the module nltk.corpus:
    <pre>
           &gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.corpus import set_basedir
           &gt;&gt;&gt; set_basedir('/home/me/nltk')
    </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
